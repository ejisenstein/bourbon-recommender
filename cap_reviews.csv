Capsule Review,Last Drop Distillers XIX: 1980 Kentucky Straight Bourbon,Classification: Straight Bourbon,Company: Sazerac UK Ltd T/A Last Drop Distillers,Distillery: Buffalo Trace (Known as the George T. Stagg Distillery at the time of distillation),Release Date: November 2020,Proof: 90,Age: 20 Years (Stored in steel tanks for an additional 20 years before bottling),Mashbill: Undisclosed,Color: Medium Copper,"MSRP: $4,600 (2020)",Official Website,Leather | Aged oak | Earthy | Raisin | Dark fruit | Dark cherry | Tobacco | Complex & inviting with distinct evidence of its age,Toffee | Coconut | Leather | Tobacco leaf | Plum | Dark cherry | Graham cracker | Seasoned oak | Spice develops | Viscous mouthfeel with a complex delivery of flavors that’s rivaled by very few,Dark Cherry | Cigar box | Aged oak | Dark chocolate | Spice tapers | Dark cherry note lingers | Caps off an incredible sip,"Founded by James Espey and Tom Jago, Last Drop Distillers seeks to find and bring to life the rarest of the rare whiskeys, offering them in extremely limited quantities and mind-numbing prices. However, unlike many limited releases that dominate our Release Calendar, Last Drop Distillers is limited in the truest sense - the whiskeys they offer cannot simply be reproduced. Generally relics of a time past and often boasting a high age, they are not easily replicated.

Release XIX is a bourbon distilled by Gary Gayheart, former master distiller at George T. Stagg Distillery (now known as Buffalo Trace) and master to his then apprentice, Harlen Wheatley, now master distiller at Buffalo Trace. A $4,600 MSRP bourbon that is limited to only 240 bottles and will surely sell for much more, I fear too much of this release will be resolved to the shelves of collectors and bottles will remain sealed. Thankfully, a 50mL sample is included with each full bottle, so hopefully that encourages buyers to at least give it a taste.  

To my surprise (and to my disdain because I probably won’t ever experience another pour of this!) it is, unequivocally, insanely good. An explosion of complex flavors in near perfect balance that somehow captures the magic of a whiskey in its prime, and doing so at a proofpoint that allows every one of the subtleties to show through. As a frame of reference, consider the now retired tanked versions of Sazerac 18 Year and Van Winkle Family Reserve Rye. Two of my all-time favorites. Now, take the characteristics of those whiskeys, ryes that were frozen in time at their absolute best, keep that magic and simply apply a layer of bourbon flavor characteristics to them. That’s Last Drop Distillers XIX Bourbon.",5,Nick,https://www.breakingbourbon.com/review/last-drop-distillers-xix-1980-kentucky-straight-bourbon

As George T. Stagg struggles to reach the consistently high ratings it once did, Stagg Jr. has picked up its slack. In fact, we gave Stagg Jr.’s 2019 Batch 12 a stellar review, even naming it our Whiskey of the Year. A year later, Batch 14 reaches similar high marks, completely nailing what it means to be a “Stagg” bourbon. Once again it is steeped in brown sugar, rich vanilla, and thick oak, except this edition forgoes previous batches’ ample amounts of molasses and cherry notes. Instead, it introduces honey, pecan, and apple. It’s not lightyears different than recent batches, but with whiskey this good, I’ll gladly take what it's offering.

At the same time, it forgoes its standard jetfuel-like temperament and is warming instead of hot. Despite the sip being straightforward and not overly complex, the highlight of this whiskey is that it is amazingly balanced. Those are two words I thought I’d never use to describe Thomas H. Handy, but it absolutely nails its intensity of its fruity sweet flavors against its typical cinnamon-forward profile. There is no doubt in my mind, this is the best Thomas H.

Looking at the label for their latest batch, it’s hard not to notice the 5.5 year age statement. It doesn’t exactly scream special. This is a great example of don’t judge a book by its cover since it’s the TTB’s regulations that require companies to state the youngest whiskey in their blend. This in fact includes 9, 13, and 15 year old bourbons.

What Barrell does deliver with Batch 025 is what you’d expect: a crowd-pleaser. From its complex nose and its delicious oak infused fruit-forward palate, it’s only the finish that comes up a bit short. There’s way too much to love with this release than find fault with, and it easily falls into the buy category. Batch 025 is a fitting tribute to what Barrell Craft Spirits has accomplished so far.",4,Eric,https://www.breakingbourbon.com/review/barrell-bourbon-batch-025

Likely utilizing the same bourbon sources as their most recent numbered bourbon batches, except this release comes with an impressive 15 year age statement. Barrell once again works their magic and finds a way to offer a heavily oaked bourbon yet still retains the expressive fruity side that so many love about their numbered batches. Never venturing too far towards tannic oak or too far tropical and sweet, the company strikes a balanced nirvana. Its low proofpoint for a barrel proof whiskey provides it with a deep richness of flavors instead of an over reliance on heat. At the same time, I would have preferred more proof from the whiskey to really drive its point home. Its $250 MSRP does feel a bit pricey, but on the other hand, its three different sourced origins and high age statement add a ton of complexity, making it stand out in a crowded year of limited edition bourbons. This release consists of a total of 12,000 bottles.",4,Eric,https://www.breakingbourbon.com/review/barrell-craft-spirits-15-year-bourbon-2020-release

Those three words sum up Elijah Craig Barrel Proof in a nutshell. Where the brand can now sometimes feel like been-there-done-that, there is no denying that this bourbon always brings its “A” game. Its flavors are always potent, proof intense, and it consistently delivers a quality pour time and time again. It might not always reach the height some of its competitors reach with certain releases, but its price and availability always make up for it. Batch C920 doesn’t quite match the excellent Batch B520 from earlier this year, but it's close, and probably splitting hairs.

Interestingly, the usual robustness typically associated with Stagg doesn’t return with it to the same degree. Out of the gate, its nose is light, requiring extra time and a swirl of the glass to open up. Its palate follows in much the same way, lacking the typical Stagg bearhug that has come to define the brand. Spice is the showcase of the palate, overshadowing its medium-intensity vanilla and leather notes. It’s in its finish that the whiskey turns itself around as it grows in complexity and intensity, making for an exceptional finish. Far from being flawed, the 2020 Stagg struggles to reach the amazing heights of years past throughout its entire sip. It’s a solid drinker overall that at times is overshadowed by the company’s own ever impressive Stagg Jr. and its competition that have stepped up their game, offering comparable and worthy Stagg alternatives.",4,Eric,https://www.breakingbourbon.com/review/george-t-stagg-2020

This year’s edition is no different than the 2019 or 2018 editions, featuring oak but still providing an incredibly complex, bold, full-flavored sip.

Their annual Little Book release does a lot to quell this complaint, with each “Chapter” standing out for something unique.

Out of the gate, Chapter 4’s blend of three different mashbill whiskeys (one of which is a brown rice bourbon) is special for Beam. As a result, its nose is the opposite of any Booker’s I’ve ever had featuring much more grassy and herbal notes. When it comes to the palate and finish though, they are predictably bold and surprisingly in the same flavor wheelhouse as Booker’s. Despite its complex blend, Chapter 4’s sip is decidedly not so.

But where Chapter 4 stands out is it cranks its cinnamon intensity to an 11. It’s beyond intense and combined with its red pepper spice, creates an explosion in your mouth. The difference this time is the flavors are doing the heavy lifting and not the proof. This results in a whiskey that is memorable in all of the right ways.",4,Eric,https://www.breakingbourbon.com/review/little-book-chapter-4-lessons-honored

Reaching its four year mark, numerous batches of Bottle in Bond were first released in June, 2020, with the bottle in review being from Batch 16D1A and bottled more recently in fall of 2020. The bourbon is made from an unusual corn-wheat mashbill that contains no malted barley, and first entered the 30 gallon level 3 char barrels at 112.5 proof where it ages underground. The resulting flavor profile is unusually sweet, but manages to keep the sweeter notes in check with a nice mouthfeel and near perfect proofing. Without question, this is one of the best bourbons I’ve ever tasted from such a young distillery, and rivals what the Kentucky majors are putting out at much higher ages. Take caution however, batches are small and the distillery is young, so there may be a wide variation from batch to batch.",4,Nick,https://www.breakingbourbon.com/review/old-55-single-barrel-bourbon-bottled-in-bond

This year's release embraces all of these unique traits and delivers a pour that will please WLW fans. It’s full of rich flavors and hugs you with a tight heat throughout the entire sip. The competition for high proof wheated bourbon has certainly increased over the years, in particular with Maker Mark’s cask strength offerings and Heaven Hill’s limited edition Old Fitzgerald and Larceny barrel proof lines.

While each of these individual finishes has been done before, they are still just making their way into bourbon finishing and as a result are rather rare. Moreover, the combination of blending these three finishes into a single blend results in one of the more interesting creations ever attempted with bourbon. Like the unique name for this product, which was inspired by company founder Joe Beatrice’s mother’s formal name, the resulting flavor profile is as unique as it sounds.

I was initially shocked by Armida, as it delivers a combination of flavors I can confidently say I have never experienced in a whiskey. In fact, I had to revisit a number of times to ground myself in what I was experiencing, and in-so-doing found myself really enjoying this intriguing blend. As you journey through this whiskey from its aroma to its palate and finally to its finish, you realize it’s on an entirely different level. The integration of the three separately finished bourbons not only exposes, but rather highlights qualities of all three finishes in a rather potent form. Despite the gripping intensity of the finishes however, the underlying bourbon offers just enough structure to tie everything together. Armida is such a complex and unexpected combination of flavors it will challenge even the most experienced whiskey drinkers.",3.5,Nick,https://www.breakingbourbon.com/review/barrell-armida
,Barrell Bourbon Batch 023,Classification: Bourbon,Company: Barrell Craft Spirits,"Distillery: Sourced (from undisclosed distilleries in Tennessee, Kentucky, and Indiana)",Release Date: February 2020,Proof: 107.78,"Age: 10 Years (Blend of 10, 12, and 15 year old barrels per company website)","Mashbill: Corn, Rye, and Malted Barley (undisclosed percentages)",MSRP: $90 (2020),Official Website,"Batch 023 is Barrell Craft Spirits’ latest release in their flagship Barrell Bourbon product line. Set to reach markets as early as February 2020, this batch blends bourbons from three states with a minimum age of 10 years, though the blend includes 10, 12, and 15 year old barrels with an interesting batching process. First, the 10 and 12 year old barrels were blended together and left to mingle. After a few months, 15 year old barrels were layered into the batch with the intent of bringing more complexity to the overall blend.

With past Barrell Bourbon batches ranging from 5 to 13 years old, Batch 023 comes in on the older side when compared with past batches considering its 10 year age statement. It also comes in on the lower proof side, with past batches ranging from Batch 016’s 105.8 to Batch 008’s whopping 132.84 proof. Notably, Barrell Bourbon is always released at barrel proof.","A waft of brown sugar gives way to caramel, oak, and baking spices. Warm buttery cornbread peeks through, along with a trace of cinnamon. Inviting, but somewhat mild in intensity given the proof.","Spicy notes take the lead, with a mix of baking spices, cinnamon, summer fruit, and black peppercorns. It’s medium-bodied mouthfeel coats the tongue nicely, allowing burnt brown sugar and toasted caramel to come forward. A touch of tobacco comes into play on the backend, along with a bit of heat.","Cinnamon spice crescendos, with baking spices and raw grain in tow. The spice hangs on the tongue, and a slight dry leather note materializes towards the end. Medium length and pleasant.","Batch 023 reminded me a bit of Barrell’s recent Batch 021. The two share the same source states, along with very similar proof and 10 year age statements. I really enjoyed Batch 021, and found myself enjoying Batch 023 as well. By comparison, Batch 021 leans a bit more towards the traditional caramel-vanilla-oak bourbon flavor profile, while Batch 023 is more spice heavy with traces of cornbread, grain, and summer fruit in the mix along with providing a bigger spice pop. As Joe Beatrice and Tripp Stimson of Barrell Craft Spirits go to great lengths to make every batch different, Batch 023 once again succeeds in providing quintessential Barrell Bourbon characteristics that I’ve come to love, but with its own unique spin.

The palate in turn transitions into a heavier ordeal of darker and richer flavors. The finish takes it a step further, leaning into pepper and bitterness. This isn’t one of the sweet and fruity batches from Barrell that they’re known for, but instead goes in the opposite direction. Providing a nice contrast to those batches, Batch 024 is yet another impressive blend by Barrell Craft Spirits that also makes for a great cigar bourbon.",3.5,Eric,https://www.breakingbourbon.com/review/barrell-bourbon-batch-024

Lot 5 is one of the more complex and intriguing whiskeys on the market. It combines an incredibly fresh and sweet nose with a more earthy and complex palate. The sip ends with a combo of both earthy and sweet, and makes you sit back and ponder how this was created. It is unlike anything else being produced in the American whiskey market and will instantly be a love-it or hate-it whiskey for most.

Old Forester’s 90 proof single barrel will no longer be available, instead replaced with a 100 proof and barrel strength single barrel versions. Bottles will also sport a redesigned bottle label that more closely resembles the brand's design since 2015.

I was taken aback at how potent it is for the proof, which isn’t a bad thing since it’s a delicious aroma.","A well-crafted palate that balances oak and its sweeter side well. Wet oak and light pecan provide a weighted base that allows the caramel, maple syrup, and cherry coke flavors to nicely play off of them. Quite enjoyable.","Like many Old Forester bourbons before this, pepper, clove, and seasoned oak dominate. This leaves a mild aftertaste of dankiness and slight bitterness. It doesn't have as impactful of a finish as it does in the small batch, but unfortunately it’s present once again.","In my Old Forester Signature Bourbon review I wrote about the drastic improvements the people behind Old Forester have made to their bourbon over the last few years. In this particular single barrel, I found it to have a little bit thinner mouthfeel than the small batch, but it didn’t matter as the flavors are more vibrant than those of the small batch overall.

To be frank, I never thought much of Old Forester single barrel selections. The brand didn’t come off as exciting and I wasn’t willing to take a chance on a more expensive single barrel version. I still have an Old Forester single barrel selection from years ago that remains pretty forgettable. Of course single barrels vary, but I’m impressed with what I tasted with this latest one, and it falls in line with what I’ve tasted overall from the brand lately. It started with the Old Forester Whiskey Row series, then the standard Old Forester bourbon saw a quality increase. It’s been getting better and better and I’m definitely willing to take a chance on an Old Forester single barrel bottle now.

Following up on the heels of last year’s release of Heavy Char Rye, the company once again is focusing on the utilization of a char Level 5 to be the distinguishing factor of this release. This differs from the customary Level 3 that Heaven HIll normally uses. Unlike last year though, Heaven Hill has chosen to amplify the age and proof even higher, resulting in a 10 year 120 proof bourbon.

Where last year’s Parker’s Heritage edition was an overall disappointment, the bourbon version of Heaven Hill’s heavy char experiment thankfully is redemption for this often lauded and popular brand. While heat and char are still big factors, they thankfully don’t drown out the other flavors or make things too lopsided. Instead, the end result is a big bold high proof bourbon that balances its age and heavy char flavor profile against traditional bourbon flavor profiles and bold spice.

This type of blend is highly unusual for the rye market which typically doesn’t get to experience the same blending creativity as much as bourbon does. The result is a grounded rye that is heavy on earthier notes and more oak forward than most ryes. Yet it also features a great mouthfeel that helps highlight the palate’s complexity by bringing forth the brightness the four base ryes produce together. This isn’t a rye you might now immediately declare your love for, but one you’ll take out at a rye tasting and prove just how unique ryes can actually be.",3.5,Eric,https://www.breakingbourbon.com/review/barrell-rye-batch-003

Overall Pact No. 6 with its Cognac finish is a flavorful barrel finished bourbon that drinks easy thanks to its sweet palate.

Located in Boston, KY, it was purchased by the James B. Beam Distilling company in the early 1950’s as a second distilling location to increase their capacity.

Booker’s is known for being a bold, high proof pour and Boston Batch lives up to those expectations. The sip is distinctly Jim Beam, starting with its nut infused nose.

It’s not the most complex Booker’s produced, however it will please those who are a fan of the brand, along with individuals who are looking for a bold, high proof pour.",3,Jordan,https://www.breakingbourbon.com/review/bookers-bourbon-boston-batch-batch-2020-02

Likely a surprise to some, the Rye Recipe is in fact a bourbon, with “rye” referring to the whiskey’s secondary grain. At seven years old, there is ample oak and leather woven throughout. The whiskey's fruit notes are its highlight, bringing a nice balance to the oak and injecting much needed dimension. Despite being largely straightforward and even somewhat boring at times, the whiskey is a rather enjoyable sip when its fruit notes open up. The Rye Recipe would actually make a great everyday bourbon if you could in fact find it on any given day in a store.

The Wheat Recipe will likely gather the most attention for its ties to the company’s uber-popular Weller brand. Those hoping it would be a new easy to find “Poor Man’s Pappy” will unfortunately be disappointed as its flavor profile shares little with the iconic brand. Instead, it has much more in common with the Weller brand as it's sweeter and lighter than Special Reserve, yet features a touch more cinnamon and oak like Antique 107 does. It would be wise to keep expectations in check, as the Wheat Recipe is an enjoyable sipper and nothing more.",3,Eric,https://www.breakingbourbon.com/review/buffalo-trace-kosher-wheat-recipe-2020-release

The whiskey leans heavily towards sweeter notes with a diverse array of flavors that really works. The nose weaves in an unusual green tea note that surprisingly works very well, and even returns shyly in the finish. While more years in the barrel may introduce some additional flavors, I find this unique and enjoyable just the way it is.

As noted, a total of 37 used casks were used for this batch, which included 21 bourbon, 10 cuvée, and 6 sherry casks making for a total of 2,554 gallons of whiskey. This resulted in a final blend of approximately 50% ex-bourbon casks, 25% ex-cuvée casks, and 25% ex-sherry casks. Like the light color of this whiskey, the flavor profile is light and airy, which lends itself to sweeter and more floral and fruity notes.

After last year’s impressive showing, expectations remain high this year. That is true in part because George Dickel whiskey is overly abundant in the marketplace, being found in perhaps too many sourced products in 2020. The company might have reached a saturation point, as the 2020 Bottled in Bond release just doesn’t stand out enough for a product being released straight from the horse’s mouth. At its best, it's more of the same, and worse, it doesn’t offer anything new or exciting. It’s amazing the difference a few years makes. If I didn’t feel like I drank this a hundred times already this year, maybe it would have left a better impression. If you missed last year’s edition, it's a decent stand-in. Although it's a bit more rough around the edges and hotter than last’s release, In the end, if you’ve had Dickel in its many various forms this year, it offers little new.",3,Eric,https://www.breakingbourbon.com/review/george-dickel-bottled-in-bond-whisky-2020-release

In addition, despite being 90 proof, the whiskey has good intensity and its flavors are well presented before it ramps up the heat during its finish. What it lacks in wow factor it makes up for in a solid delivery that justifies its $50 asking price. It’s worth noting that despite this being sourced from Tennessee  - where one wouldn’t be blamed for automatically concluding it's from George Dickel - the mashbill doesn't line up, adding an interesting level of intrigue about this whiskey’s true origins.",3,Eric,https://www.breakingbourbon.com/review/heavens-door-tennessee-bourbon

Likely surprising many, Hudson Whiskey has been operating since 2003 and was the first New York distillery since Prohibition. Yet, the company has seemingly struggled to stand out to the unknowing or at the very least, stay in the mindshare of those who do know it. Story aside, Do the Rye Thing, which is in fact a rebranding of their Manhattan Rye, is quite the satisfying sipping rye. Why the company maintains a low age statement despite its many years distilling is anyone's guess, as it is the main drawback to an otherwise great tasting whiskey. This is a rye that forgoes much of the typical heat and spice of rye whiskeys, and instead puts forth a surprisingly delicate and fruit-leaning flavor profile.

The bourbon in review is from batch 03, the highest proof of the three batches. The bourbon offers a fairly complex sip without a particular highlight of any flavor, instead providing a wide array of flavors in relative balance. However, it drinks a bit hot which detracts from the overall experience.

The concept of three distinct batches drawn from the 150 barrels, or really 147 as 3 of the barrels were completely lost to the Angel’s Share, is a fascinating one and makes me wish I could compare them. Unfortunately, the price makes that a challenge at $150 (notice a number trend here?), and without an age statement it’s not entirely clear how different the bourbon within the bottles is relative to some of Old Forester’s other releases. With that being said, each batch’s relatively small barrel count, its throwback amber bottle and tube, and one-off nature undoubtedly makes this a collector’s item.",3,Nick,https://www.breakingbourbon.com/review/old-forester-150th-anniversary-bourbon

The flavors all come at you at one speed and aren’t quite as punchy as I’d like them to be. The sip has a bold flavor overall thanks to its proof, but it's just not very exciting.","A long hot finish of pecan, seasoned oak, burnt caramel, pepper, and mild bitterness. It’s a serviceable finish that packs flavor and heat, but like the palate, it isn't very thrilling.","Old Forester has made dramatic quality improvements to their Old Forester bourbon brand over the last five years. Their Prohibition Style and Statesman bourbons have been prime examples of this change, and their new 100 proof Old Forester Single Barrel is also quite impressive.

Unfortunately, the particular single barrel I tasted at barrel strength wasn’t quite ready for prime time. All of the brightness and interesting mingling of flavors from the 100 proof single barrel didn’t carry over to the barrel strength. It's a flat wall of flavor that, despite its hotness, doesn’t translate that intensity of the flavors to the same degree. It’s by no means bad, but this particular single barrel isn’t up to the task of being a Stagg Jr. or Elijah Craig Barrel Proof replacement for me.

MGP rye whiskey comes in many forms from many distilleries and producers these days, but this whiskey showcases how adding staves can transform it into something new. If you’re not a fan of stave finishing, this won’t convert you. Yet others may find this to be an interesting pour. It’s clear the staves are hiding its youthful notes as you can taste subtle hints of them here and there, but it also sports an appealing richness that is hard to deny. Inserting staves may never fully replace traditional aging time in the barrel, but they can produce something that may otherwise never reach this degree of richness. Some might find it manufactured, and others will be intrigued by it. While it may not have made me a convert to stave finishing, I did enjoy my time sipping it.

This makes an enjoyable first impression. A quick swirl of the glass brings forward additional notes of rye spice and mild cinnamon that nicely balances the initial scents.","A sweet and spicy fusion of cinnamon sugar and rye spice with faint drafts of cocoa and cinnamon bark. It’s a straightforward flavor profile at first, but the contrasting sweet and spice quickly becomes its most notable element and turns the palate into quite the enjoyable sipper.","Much more grain-forward on the finish, yet it's not so much as a youthful grain taste, as more of a focus on its barley and rye grain components. Its oak influence is on the lighter side, which allows the grains to be highlighted moreso. It’s unique tasting and not what you’d expect.","A lot of people will probably see Wheel Horse Rye and think of it as yet another young rye whiskey from an upstart distillery. While that is true, Wheel Horse Rye has a few things that make it stand out, most notably its price. Craft whiskey is often expensive and in some cases overpriced for what it is. Wheel Horse Rye bucks this by offering an easy-sipping rye that, while its finish may not be for everyone, is unique tasting, and it’s only $28. There aren't as many whiskeys in this price range as there used to be, and its surprising a new entry is from an upstart distillery. The Wheel Horse brand is making a bold statement releasing this at $28.  But to be frank, I wasn’t blown away by this the first time I had it. It's straightforward and the finish comes out of left field at first sip. But the more I dissected its palate and finish, the more I noticed its sweetness and drinkability, and I came to understand its finish more. There is no denying it's another young whiskey on the market, but at $28, and from a pure drinkability standpoint, it works.

The nose smells like you’re about to dive into a spicy jalapeno cocktail and the rest of the sip plows forward with bold pepper flavors. It seems a fitting tribute to its origins in the southwest, and if you're a fan of chili peppers, you may gravitate towards this.

That said, this is truly love it or hate it whiskey with many people probably being in the latter camp due to its exotic flavor profile. While I can’t see too many people reaching for a neat pour all too often, I could see this being used as an interesting twist in a cocktail. I found this whiskey to be too chili pepper dominant, but I do have to give Adventurous Stills credit for making something different.

,Clyde May’s Straight Rye,Classification: Straight Rye,Company: Conecuh Brands,Distillery: Sourced (From an undisclosed distillery in Indiana),Release Date: Ongoing,Proof: 94,Age: 3 Years,Mashbill: Undisclosed,MSRP: $45 (2020),Website,"Clyde May’s Rye is aptly named after Clyde May who was an Alabama farmer. May had a storied history as being a talented moonshiner in the mid-20th century, refining his craft over the years and ultimately spending time in a federal penitentiary because of this. Known for his usage of oven-dried apples, May would add these to his barrels during the aging process resulting in a distinctive flavor profile. In 2001, May’s son recreated his father's recipe and legally began distilling Clyde May’s.

The bottle of Clyde May’s Rye itself sports a green and white label, which is representative of the colors in Clyde’s prison cell. While the whiskey is currently sourced, the company announced plans in late 2017 to open a distillery in Troy, Alabama. Construction has been delayed, with groundbreaking now expected to start in early 2020. The bottle being reviewed is from Batch 003 and its label states it’s aged a minimum of 3 years.","Youthful hints of sweet vanilla, corn, light rye grain, green apple, and ripe honeydew. The scents work as a nice way to start the sip, however the youth of the whiskey is more prevalent than I would have preferred.","Lightly charred oak, green peppercorn, and green apples mix with sweeter flavors of vanilla, syrup, and hints of toasted brown sugar. The spice is more noticeable in the sip versus the nose, however it comes across as slightly unbalanced.","Fresh baked bread, corn, and sweet vanilla all lay on top of a lingering rye spice note. The spice lasts for a surprisingly long time and is one of the highlights of the sip.","Clyde May’s Rye first attempt into the rye market for the brand leaves a lot of room for growth. Its higher proof allows for a nice variation in flavors to come forward. However in this case, the variation in flavors can come across as unbalanced and don’t play as well against the youthful undertone that are found throughout. As the brand switches from sourced to in-house distilled whiskey in the coming years, it will be interesting to see how the flavor profile changes over time.

It’s pleasant as it gently swells from the glass. The scents work well together, but the aroma will make you do a double take. As familiar as the scents come across at first, you’ll get a sudden injection of rum that transforms it into something weirdly unexpected.","A heavy dose of rye spice greets you, which transitions into a mishmash of traditional rye and rum flavors of spice, cinnamon, molasses, and brown sugar. That’s not to say the overall flavor is bad per say, but it's hard to taste individual flavors here. In a way this makes it come across as more of a simple pre-mixed cocktail. It’s enjoyable to drink, as long as you don’t expect much.","This is where the rum influence really rears its head. There’s a noticeable ramp up of sweetness, but it's surprisingly fleeting. It provides an interesting contrast to the rye notes found in the palate, but unfortunately transitions into an off-tasting, vinegary, and ethanol affair. It thankfully quickly dissipates, leaving an enjoyable, albeit mild, molasses aftertaste.","Overall Redemption Rye Rum Cask Finish is an easy drinker, and I’m sure plenty of people will find joy in drinking it. Its finish is flawed, and where some will be willing to overlook it, for others, it will be a dealbreaker. If you want to treat this as a pre-mixed cocktail as its palate suggests, the whiskey’s 94 proof can be problematic. Adding some water or even club soda does help cut its proof and transform it into a decent pseudo-cocktail, but there is a razor thin line where if you add too much water it loses all of its character. At $35, it’s priced on the low side for a finished whiskey, but its flaws keep it from being a recommended purchase. There are still some kinks to be worked out here. While its mellow rum influence might be more palatable to drinkers, it can’t compete with Angel’s Envy’s Rye complexity. Utilizing rum as a blending or finishing agent is interesting, but I’m not sure if anyone has completely cracked it yet in the American whiskey-sphere. It still has to be proven if rum is as complementary to whiskey as wine is when it comes to finishing, but the potential is there.
