In Depth Review,Parker's Heritage Collection: Promise of Hope,Classification: Straight Bourbon,Company: Heaven Hill,Distillery: Heaven Hill,Released: Fall 2013,Proof: 96,Age: 10 Years,Mashbill: Undisclosed,Color:  Amber,MSRP: $90 (2014),Official Website,"This is the 7th edition of the annual Parker’s Heritage Collection (PHC). This release will mark the first time that a single barrel American whiskey has been offered in the collection.  According to the press release, Parker Beam painstakingly sampled and selected bourbon barrels that met his own personal “wish list” criteria. He selected approximately 100 barrels of ten-year-old rye-based Bourbon from one of his favorite warehouses, the tiered 80-year-old Rickhouse EE in Deatsville, where they sat in high storage for 40 seasons. In addition, for each bottle sold, $20 will be donated to the Parker Beam Promise of Hope Fund, a fund established through the ALS Association.","A perfectly balanced, sweet smelling nose. Hints of fruits and spice, enhanced with oak. Caramelized sugar, honey and maple stand out the most. They should make a cologne that smells like this.","A very complex splash of flavors when it hits the tongue. Caramelized sugar and apples, with dashes of sweet honey and maple syrup. It tastes much like it smells, which doesn’t always happen with bourbon.","As it settles on the back of your tongue, oak characteristics come into play. Caramel also begin to pull out over the sugars. A perfect amount of burn develops to finish off the experience, though it ends a bit quicker than expected.","A truly balanced bourbon is hard to come by. Many bourbons strive for it. Many fail and instead begin to focus on gimmicks. When Parker Beam and Heaven Hill released what their 2013 Parker’s Heritage would be, it didn’t immediately spark a tidal wave of interest like previous years. We’ve all been promised balanced, well rounded bourbon before. Maybe after too many disappointments it’s hard to get excited about it. Arguably, there are only a few bourbons on the market that begin to reach this level: Four Roses and E.H. Taylor continue to impress year after year, Buffalo Trace Antique Collection maintains high quality and for those lucky enough to find a bottle, Pappy Van Winkles do. Balanced bourbon is a pipe dream, or so we thought. Promise of Hope is unique in that regard. It talks the talk and surprisingly, walks the walk.","Let it be said: $90-$100 for a 10 year old bourbon is a bit crazy. There are many bourbons on the market at the same age for a third to half the price. Why then would anyone take a second glance at Parker’s Promise of Hope? This may be the closest we get to a perfect bourbon. Yes, that is high praise, yet the bourbon can back that claim. Promise of Hope is as balanced as bourbons come (in 2013). Any bourbon priced near a Franklin has the cards stacked against it. This is one reveals a full house.","Extremely well-rounded and balanced, this just might be remembered as one the best bourbons of the decade.","No doubt about it: Promise of Hope is one of the top bourbons of 2013. Parker’s Heritage collection continues to stand out and deserves the praise it gets. Not only is every release different, but every one maintains a high level of quality. Parker’s decision to pull from his favorite warehouse, location in said warehouse, age, proof and release it as a single barrel is hard to disagree with. Promise of Hope might just be remembered as one of the most well-rounded bourbons to ever be released. Don’t miss your chance to experience this gem.",Eric,4.5,5,5,3,3,5,https://www.breakingbourbon.com/review/parkers-heritage-collection-promise-of-hope
In Depth Review,Van Winkle Family Reserve Rye,Classification: Straight Rye,Company: Sazerac Company Inc.,Distillery: Old Rip Van Winkle Distillery / Buffalo Trace,Released: October 2013 / Yearly Release,Proof: 95.6,Age: 13 Years,Mashbill: Undisclosed,Color:  Reddish Copper,MSRP: $65 (2014),Official Website,"Number D952. Recently the Van Winkles entered into a joint venture with Buffalo Trace Distillery, where production currently takes place with their oversight. The Van Winkle’s have been in the bourbon industry since the late 1800’s. Julian III, grandson of the original Julian P. “Pappy” Van Winkle, Sr. currently runs the company. His son, Preston, joined in 2001 and it’s anticipated that he will continue their family tradition. According to Chuck Cowdery via Whiskey Advocate, the Van Winkle Family Reserve Rye has been a 50/50 combination of Medley and Cream of Kentucky rye whiskeys. It was put into steel tanks years ago and is being drawn down for each fall release.","Vanilla, caramel, and fresh wood. Easy to sniff. Smells more like bourbon than rye.","The rye comes forward immediately, but then it fades back to bourbon-like elements evidenced on the nose. Youthful rye spice, cinnamon, and black pepper followed by caramel, vanilla, burnt brown sugar, and fresh wood. Other flavors are evident (in a good way), they’re just difficult to pinpoint.",A sweetness creeps up and lingers for a bit. Medium length. Leaves a nice aftertaste and entices you to go back for more.,"I’m fortunate to have experienced a good number of ryes. There are a limited number of total options and even fewer on any given day at any given liquor store. The Van Winkle Family Reserve is one of the best ryes money can buy, if you can find it that is. It has high corn in the mashbill compared with other ryes, but the sweetness is not overpowering. There are other good choices of course. Willett produces quality ryes based on hand selecting the barrels and then bottling them, typically at a much younger age - these are very good when you can find them. Thomas H. Handy and Sazerac 18 are released once a year as part of the Buffalo Trace Antique Collection, each is excellent but in a way that contrasts with the other. Handy is heavy-weight flavor punch while Saz 18 is delicate and balanced. High West has produced a number of high quality ryes which also contrast but complement one another nicely. There are numerous others I could list but the point is this - the Van Winkle has something different. Ryes reach maturity at a young age, typically 6-8 years but even less in some cases. Adding age should add interest and complexity, and the Van Winkle is the epitome of quality aging. 13 years in a barrel, perfect balance, wood and rye elements, a rich and full texture… it’s really something special. I’ll talk about an “X-factor” sometimes in my reviews. It’s that element you can’t really explain but you know it’s there. It’s just awesome for some hard-to-describe reason. This has that.","If you see it buy it. This may be the hardest of the Van Winkle lineup to locate and sees lowest production of the bunch. It’s a bargain for anything less than $75, and still worth considering upwards of $150. I know this sells for up to $600 in the aftermarket, but that has no bearing on my value rating in this review. It is great stuff. It’s really hard to find, and it’s something you won’t regret purchasing. If you’re lucky enough to find a bottle open and share it, don’t horde this one.","Delicious and memorable. A perfect balance of spicy and sweet, youth and age.","There’s something amazing happening here. It’s as if the master distiller knew exactly when to pull the barrel… which of course he did. You can taste the age, but it’s not overdone. You can taste the youthful elements, but they don’t overpower the age. It balances rye spice with bourbon-like sweetness to give us something that’s delicious and memorable. This is a top notch rye that deserves the praise it gets.",Nick,3.5,5,4.5,4.5,5,5,https://www.breakingbourbon.com/review/van-winkle-family-reserve-rye
In Depth Review,Barrell Bourbon Batch 006,Classification: Straight Bourbon,Company: Barrell Craft Spirits,Distillery: Sourced (From an undisclosed distillery in Tennessee),Released: November 2015,Proof: 122.9,"Age: 8 Years, 6 Months","Mashbill: 70% Corn, 26% Rye, 4% Malted Barley",Color:  Dark Rose Gold,MSRP: $90 (2017),Official Website,"Barrell Bourbon is sourced bourbon released periodically in sequentially numbered batches. The company’s mantra is to seek out unique whiskeys and release them at barrel proof, striving to offer no two batches that are alike.

The bottle in review is from Batch 006, bottle number 2000. It was sourced from the same distillery as Barrell Bourbon Batch 005, but aged in a lower level of the rickhouse. The Batch 006 release consisted of about 35 barrels with approximately 43% evaporation loss, resulting in a total yield of approximately 5,460 bottles (910 cases).","Like Barrell Bourbon Batch 005 there is a little burn at first, however unlike Batch 005 after a few minutes it dissipates almost entirely leaving a full-bodied array of pleasant scents behind. Raisins and dark fruit are accented by cinnamon and a hint of citrus, with seasoned oak rounding things out. It’s rich and inviting, making for one of the best noses I’ve experienced in a while.","Raisins and dark fruit play nicely alongside cinnamon gum. Seasoned wood balances things, providing a prominent undertone throughout the mouth-coating and richly flavored palate. It’s hard to describe each one individually, but there is a depth of flavors here that pulls through quite prominently. For a bourbon that’s over 120 proof, it’s surprising how flavor-forward it is beyond the burn, making for an exceptional sip.","Sweet burnt brown sugar tames the cinnamon spice that carries over from the palate, and light seasoned oak notes round things out. A perfect amount of burn and aftertaste that stays true to the rest of the experience. Warming and oh so long, what I wish all whiskey finishes would be. Admittedly I may have said “wow” out loud a few times, causing my wife to question what I was so excited about.","The company’s mantra is to provide a unique and different bourbon with every barrel proof batch. Interestingly, this bourbon shares similar roots with the company’s previous Batch 005 release. It comes from the same undisclosed distillery in Tennessee, shares the same mash bill, is only about 3 months older, and is about the same proof; however it was aged in a lower level of the rickhouse. While I enjoyed Batch 005 so much it made my Favorites of 2015 list, I have to say I actually like Batch 006 better.

Tasting them side by side I can pinpoint underlying similarities, but much like siblings, the two batches have come into their own as they’ve aged as the end result is two different bourbons. While Batch 005 is a delicious dose of spice, Batch 006 is much more mellow, providing a rich, deep flavor profile with accents of seasoned oak throughout. Despite Batch 005 and 006 being nearly identical in both origin and age, I actually noticed a good deal more wood influence with Batch 006. Like Batch 005, Batch 006 tastes unlike any other barrel proof bourbon I’ve had.","$90 is a lot for just about any bourbon. While I found Batch 005 to be fair at that price, I find Batch 006 to be of greater value by comparison. While this bourbon’s origin is not overly exciting and it’s only eight and a half years old, that proves to be enough. It’s value lies very simply in the bourbon within the bottle, a bourbon made for drinking. By comparison, though it doesn’t necessarily taste like any of those in the Buffalo Trace Antique Collection (BTAC) specifically, the quality and experience are within the same range. As a result, I have no hesitation recommending it as an alternative for those unable to find a bottle of BTAC. To put it simply, if you happen to be searching for a high end bourbon at a high end price, I’m confident you will find it in Barrell Bourbon Batch 006. Act quickly though, as there were only about 5,460 bottles produced.","Barrell Bourbon ups the ante with Batch 006, an exceptional experience from start to finish.","Barrell Bourbon Batch 006 is one of the best new bourbons I've tasted recently. An incredible nose followed by a richly complex palate and an exceptional finish make this a truly remarkable bourbon. I am and will continue to be a little skeptical of whether Barrell will be able to deliver high quality bourbons with every unique batch. However, as this is the second batch I’ve experienced, the company is now two for two in my book. Only time will tell, and with that in mind I highly recommend trying Barrell Bourbon Batch 006 before it’s too late.

In Depth Review,Booker's Rye,Straight Rye,Beam Suntory,Jim Beam,June 2016,136.2,"13 Years, 1 Month, 12 Days",Undisclosed,Dark Copper,$300 (2016),,"Booker's Rye is the first rye whiskey released under the Booker’s brand. Originally laid down in oak in 2003 by Booker Noe as some of the last barrels he filled before passing in 2004, it finished aging and was pulled under the guidance of his son Fred Noe. The rye was aged in one of Booker’s Noe’s favorite rack houses, and was bottled uncut and unfiltered. The first release of the Booker’s Rye took place in June 2016. A limited supply of Booker’s Rye was held back for purposes of future fundraising and charitable support. Beam released 276 bottles in the fall of 2017 to support victims of Hurricane Harvey and Hurricane Irma with 100% of the company’s proceeds from sales donated to local Feeding America food banks and Operation BBQ Relief.

The bottle being reviewed is number 3226.","This is the definition of a deceptively high proof whiskey. Coming in at a 130+ proof you would expect a bold dose of ethanol, however there’s only enough to let you know it’s high in proof without being overly hot. Instead you’re greeted with a classic rye smell of rye grain, white pepper, oak, and leather, along with a touch of caramel sweetness. This is as deep as it is rich, which provides a great nosing experience each time you bring the glass to your nose.","A big bold rye is delivered in the sip. Unlike the nose, the palate comes out swinging immediately from the start and lets you know that this is a rye that’s not to be taken lightly. A great mouthfeel delivers rye spice, allspice, citrus peel oil, and cinnamon bark, along with a peppery heat that engulfs your mouth. The palate is surprisingly nuanced and full of flavor for such a high proof whiskey, and each sip delivers a great dose of flavor.","Spicy. Really spicy in a great way. A huge amount of heat billows up from my throat into my mouth as I swallow. I’m greeted with a drier finish consisting of aged oak, leather, and cigar box undertones. A dry, chewy oak finish full of rye spice lingers for a really long time. This is everything you want out of a higher aged high proof rye.","Multiple factors make this truly a one of a kind rye from Beam. Aged almost 3 years longer than Booker’s 25th Anniversary and almost double the time the standard Booker’s spends in the barrel, this is one of the higher aged ryes that's been releases to the market. Beam doesn’t disclose the mashbill, but Booker’s Rye tastes different than the standard Beam rye mashbill which is 51% rye. It also doesn’t taste like a 95% rye which you commonly find in the market from MGP. Instead it tastes somewhere in the middle. Finally you have its high proof point. While Booker’s Bourbons are often in the low 120’s to low 130’s, fewer ryes exist and as a result it's more rare to see such a high proof rye.   All those factors aside, you also have to take into account the history of this bottling. Even if Jim Beam has a few barrels laying around of this rye that is being extra aged, this is most likely the first and the last rye that was placed in the barrel by Booker Noe. It nicely symbolizes the transition between father and son with Booker placing this in the barrel and Fred determining when was the right time to dump it out. In a time when everyone is trying to come up with the most unique off-the-wall story about their product, Booker’s Rye relies on the simple fact that it it’s a one-of-a-kind release that was created by a one-of-a-kind man. That’s pretty hard to beat in my book.

","Three. Hundred. Dollars. While that’s expensive for any American whiskey, it was unheard of for an American rye at the time, especially one that was only 13 years old. While it comes with a one-of-a-kind backstory and delivers a fantastic flavor profile, at first it was hard not to be gobsmacked by its price tag. When Jim Beam released the fantastic Booker’s 25th Anniversary for $100 everyone was shocked. How could an extra aged Booker’s be worth double the price of the standard release? While it seemed slow to build momentum, most people eventually realized it was a fantastic bourbon and prices quickly skyrocketed in the secondary market. Surely Beam took note of what was taking place and tried to course correct that with Booker's Rye.

To me though, Jim Beam overshot the price they charged for this rye. While Booker’s Rye is one of the better ryes released in recent years, it’s hard for me to justify a $300 price tag when there are so many other good ryes out there. Let’s be clear, I’m not talking about other ryes that will deliver the same experience that Booker’s Rye delivers, but instead these are ryes that are good in their own right. For the price of one bottle of Booker’s rye I could literally buy every single bottle of rye on our best of list. While I can’t blame a distillery capitalizing on a limited release, it’s hard to also justify the price tag that Beam ultimately chose for this. With that being said, high quality ryes like this don’t come along every day, so for some the additional premium will be easier to justify in their book.

",A big bold rye that lives up to the legend of one of the biggest bourbon distillers of modern times.,"Booker’s Rye is a good reminder of why limited releases should be opened and enjoyed. What you’re rewarded with is a fantastic rye at an albeit painfully high price point. While the price is questionable and on the surface hard to justify, the whiskey inside is the exact opposite. Booker’s Rye is a fantastic big bold rye that makes you yearn to see more products like this on the shelves. I can only hope that Booker laid down a lot more rye barrels than Beam is letting on and that we’ll see one or two more releases of this extra aged rye as a result. If not, one can only hope that Fred has been tasting this all along the way and decided to replicate his father’s experiment early on in the aging process. The fact of the matter is, this is one rye that everyone should have a chance to try.

In Depth Review,Elijah Craig 21 Year,Classification: Straight Bourbon,Company: Heaven Hill,Distillery: Heaven Hill,Released: October 2013,Proof: 90,Age: 21 Years,"Mashbill: 78% Corn, 12% Malted Barley, and 10% Rye",Color:  Copper,MSRP: $150 (2013),Official Website,"Barreled on 11/26/90, Barrel Number 38","On the first quick whiff you get a light scent of cereal. Taking a long deep breath pulls out a luscious smell of raisins and dried fruit. Subtle hints of allspice dance in the background but this bourbon knows what it’s doing. There are no harsh alcohol smells at all. This is bourbon that’s sat around for a while and when it came out of the barrel, it came out with an air of dignity to it. Elijah Craig 21 Year (EC 21) isn’t the young guy in the room who wants to pummel your nose with a non-stop bombardment of smells. No, this is a bourbon that knows it’s good, and only after spending time with it will you start to appreciate the subtleness it holds.

However, adding 5-6 drops of water to this bourbon instantly brings out additional smells. Lush deep smells of maraschino cherries, vanilla, and a hint of caramel and raisins come rushing at you. I couldn’t stop smelling this bourbon after adding water. I could have sat all night just inhaling that deep intoxicating smell.","On first sip you get a long oaky palate upfront. Not as sweet as the nose would lead you to believe, but you definitely pick up light hints of dandelion, aged tobacco, and wood. It just lingers in your mouth for so long that you sit there savoring each sip. Again, adding a few drops totally changes that flavor profile. You’re treated to a flavor of spicy cinnamon, peaches, cherries, light honey & vanilla. And the best part is that palate flavor lasted just as long upfront.","EC 21 hangs around on your taste buds for dear life as this finish just lasts and lasts and lasts. Just when you thought it’s done, it rears right back at you with a lingering woody taste still, but added to it is subtle hints of allspice and nut.

After adding water that finish gets more subtle and less woody. Suddenly subtle tastes of flavors start morphing from one to another. Light ginger, the crispness of a first bite of a fresh snap pea, cotton candy, cinnamon apples, caramel all keep morphing from one to another. In the end though, it comes back to a delicious nonstop lingering dried fruit flavor.  You’ll want to take long pauses and play with this bourbon as all of these flavors keep developing.","Aged bourbons are having their time in the spotlight right now. EC 21 is no exception to this as Heaven Hill released this as a one-off release. Much like EC 20 in 2012 and soon EC 22 in 2014, EC21 is a unique snapshot in time. What’s exciting about this EC series is the legacy of EC 18 as a well-loved staple in the Heaven Hill lineup. These high aged releases allow the drinker to see how a loved staple ages as time goes on. It is amazing that for such old bourbon, it’s not overpowered by a woody taste at all. Heaven Hill let this one out right at the perfect moment and is rewarded greatly for it.","The only negative going for this bourbon is value. It’s an amazing bourbon no doubt, however it’s also almost double the price of the Buffalo Trace Antique Collection and $50 more than great bourbons that can be had for a $100. Knowing that EC18 used to sell for $50 and that the this new EC series sells for $150 certainly hurts. Would I recommend buying this bottle? Sure, but only if you realize that you could also get some phenomenal bourbons for a lot less that are just as hard to find.","Will it get better with age? No one knows, but for now EC21 is simply king of the hill.","Putting aside the fact that this is slightly overpriced, this bourbon is phenomenal. From the moment you pour a glass, you’re treated to a gorgeous copper colored bourbon with legs that want to make their presence known all day long. Make sure to add 5-6 drops of water, as you’ll be rewarded with a supremely luscious smell that is backed up with an equally delicious palate and finish. I can only hope that future releases of the EC series stay this good as the age increases, as I’m truly going to miss this bourbon when the bottle's gone.",Jordan,5,4,5,4.5,2,4.5,https://www.breakingbourbon.com/review/elijah-craig-21-year

A smell of aged wood, raisin, caramel and a hint of corn dance across your nose, transporting you right to the middle of an aging warehouse on a warm spring day in Kentucky. While the alcohol wants to overpower the senses, overall the balance of the wood smell evens this bourbon out nicely. Let this one sit for a few minutes, and the smell just keeps getting more and more delicious.",Initially a sweet taste of caramel hits your tongue that instantly is replaced with a taste of all-spice and leather. The palate hits quick and to the point.,"It's a nice long finish that stays with you for a while. Due to the high proof you might be inclined to say it’s a sharp harsh finish, when in reality that’s just the alcohol dissipating from your mouth. As it mellows, you get hints of candy corn and rubber, finishing on a note of wet wood and tobacco. It's definitely a strange combination, however it just works in this case.","Being part of the Buffalo Tarce Antique Collection yearly release gives this bourbon a sense of uniqueness to begin with. If you take away the fact that this is a limited edition bourbon that you’re only going to be able to find once a year, you’re still getting a unique 15 year aged barrel proof bourbon that is packed full of flavor.","A $70 bourbon better hold your attention, and thankfully this year’s edition of Stagg certainly does. For only $20 more than a Stagg Jr. or an Elijah Craig Barrel Proof, you get a premium aged 15 yr old bourbon that embodies the definition of sophisticated bourbon. It's so good, that you’ll want to stock up on a couple of bottles to last you the year until the next release.",Delicious nose with a bold body to back it up.,"Another unique factor to this year’s Stagg is the “low” proof. The lowest proof Stagg to date at 128.2 proof, and while many regular Stagg drinkers may be disappointed by the decrease  in proof, I thought the drop made this just as fantastic bourbon in years past. It’s still the same monster bourbon individuals are used to, however it's in a more manageable proof. This is a bourbon that you want to savor the entire time you’re sipping it and one that you’ll want to share with the fellow bourbon lovers in your life.",Jordan,5,4.5,3.5,4,4.5,4.5,https://www.breakingbourbon.com/review/george-t-stagg-2013-release
In Depth Review,Lux Row Distillers Double Barrel Bourbon,Classification: Straight Bourbon,Company: Lux Row Distillers,Distillery: Undisclosed Kentucky Distillery(ies),Release Date: October 2019,Proof: 118.4,Age: 12 Years,Mashbill: Undisclosed,Color: Reddish Copper,MSRP: $150 (2019),Official Website,"Lux Row Distillers Double Barrel Bourbon is a new limited edition bourbon that commemorates the opening of Lux Row Distillers’ distillery. The “Double Barrel” in its name represents the process of selecting two 12 year old bourbon barrels that pair well together. The two barrels are then blended together and the barrel numbers are noted on the bottle’s label. This release is bottled at 118.4 proof, which is an intentional nod to the distillery's grand opening in April 2018. Each barrel pairing has been slightly proofed down to reach this mark. The bottles are labeled as cask strength, and the company confirmed with us their use of  “cask strength” describes a whiskey that has not been “substantially diluted after leaving the barrel.” Approximately 6,000 bottles will be released, and are available only in Kentucky. Barrel numbers of our media sample weren’t provided.","A deliciously sweet aroma of caramel, dark cherries, and sherry that’s punctuated with seasoned oak and leather. The scents flow strongly from the glass with their boldness. The nose is warming and lavish, and is a welcoming way to start the sip.","A warm and thick mouthfeel beautifully carries the bourbon’s sweet and impressionable flavor profile. A well orchestrated rollout of cherry, plum, red wine, and pomegranate gives way to a strong oak backbone. The flavors are well paired, and its proof does well to intensify them without drowning them out. This is a delicious flavor profile that puts pure drinkability above anything else.","A bit straightforward and dry at first, its heat ramps up and leaves a delicious hot aftertaste of cherry, cinnamon, and oak that can be shockingly intense and rewarding. Big heat, strong oak, and length results in a finish that is more than it appears at first sip.","A “double barrel” bourbon is a term that distilleries use very loosely and there doesn’t seem to be a clear universal agreement of the term. Some distilleries use it interchangeably with “twice-barreled” as a way to describe a bourbon that has been put into a second barrel for finishing (e.g. Woodford Reserve Double Oaked). More recently, some distilleries have been using the term as a way to describe a marrying between two different barrels of bourbon into a micro batch (e.g. Chicken Cock 10 Year Double Barrel Bourbon).

This micro batch process isn’t something that has been widely used in the industry so far. As a labor intensive process, it doesn't make sense for large distilleries to attempt it - at least so far. The main reason is the process’s main selling point of curating specific barrels together is extremely hands-on and time consuming. Where single barrels can be faulted for being too unpredictable and inconsistent, and small batches faulted for their homogeneous character, Lux Row makes the case that micro batches fit in the perfect Goldilock’s Zone. It remains to be seen if Lux Row has the bandwidth to make this a repeatable limited release, or even how consistent the quality of the barrel pairings will be over the course of this year’s release. That said, they’re one of the first larger scale distilleries attempting this.","It would seem double barrel bourbons need to be regulated to limited release and premium priced simply based on their labor intensive process. It would be a tall order for these releases to be done on a large scale at a marginal increase in price. Even selecting and bottling single barrel bourbons is an expensive process for distilleries, usually requiring separate bottling lines dedicated to them. Now factor in the amount of time it would take just to sample, pair, and blend just two barrels together for a double barrel release, let alone the amount it will take for this 6000 bottle release, and this whole process seems daunting for a distillery to take on. Yet the fact that Lux Row Distillers Double Barrel Bourbon is priced competitively with other limited release bourbons is quite surprising and shows the company is working hard to make their mark in the industry. If Lux Row Distillers can maintain the quality level on par with the barrel pairing I tasted, this will go down as one of the best tasting limited releases this year.",A unique barrel pairing method that achieves a satisfying middle ground between single barrel and small batch bourbons that results in a fantastic tasting sip.,"Lux Row Distillers has been on a tear over the last few years thanks to their releases of Rebel Yell Single Barrel and Old Ezra Barrel Strength. They needed a limited release in their newly refreshed lineup and took a chance with the “double barrel” concept. There’s no guarantee these micro batches will result in dramatically better bourbon than a single barrel or larger batched release, but the batch I tasted is a beautiful proof of concept and an all around fantastic tasting bourbon. There could be a time soon where distilleries try and profit off the “double barrel” term, and blindly blend two barrels together and send it off with little oversight. That doesn’t appear to be the case with this Lux Row Distillers Double Barrel Bourbon release. Mileage may vary from micro batch to micro batch, but if the company can continue to carefully curate this limited release, they have a real contender on their hands.

This one is so layered in complexity and delightful it actually enhances each sip to take a sniff first.","Much less spicy than would be expected for a rye. Dry and sweet, with an amazing balance. Just like the nose there is little if any burn here. Vanilla, maple, and citrus lightly mingle together, with no single element overpowering another. Smokey wood enters towards the end but does not overpower the other flavors as you might anticipate from 18 long years in a barrel. Maybe it’s the age or maybe it’s just low on rye in the mashbill, either way this does not have that kick you get with most ryes.","One of the longest and most complex finishes of any whiskey I’ve had. Outstanding. It ends as amazingly as it starts, as perfectly balanced wood, fruit, and spice linger for minutes after the sip. It fades away elegantly maintaining balance even as the flavors dissipate over time. Wood is more evident here than the nose or palate, but it is still perfectly balanced.","The Sazerac 18 has a fairly interesting background. It is, of course, part of the highly anticipated Buffalo Trace Antique Collection annual release. From our calculations (see our 2013 Buffalo Trace Antique Collection Fact Sheet for some interesting factoids), approximately 4,360 bottles were released in 2013. That’s less than 90 bottles per state before you account for if and how much might be allocated outside of the United States. Even more interesting is that this was put into barrels back in 1985. So it’s really 28 years old if you want to get technical about it. However, it was removed from the barrels in 2003 and put into stainless steel tanks to prevent further aging. Since then, Buffalo Trace has been drawing down from this supply while waiting for more to come of age. I don’t know when the last of this stainless steel supply will be, but I am eagerly awaiting the release poured fresh from the barrel to compare the two. There is quite a bit of debate as to how much impact the stainless steel may or may not have on the flavor, but I can imagine there will be some notable differences once we put some of this old juice side by side with whatever comes directly out of the currently aging barrels.","I’m going to be clear in this - if you appreciate a balanced whiskey then buy it if you see it, you may not have another opportunity. There are few that contend with the near perfect balance attained by this one.","Epic nose and finish, balanced throughout but subtle in all regards.","I have to be honest on this, I did not fully appreciate this the first time I had it ( sampling a previous release from a friend’s collection alongside of some other whiskeys). Being bombarded with barrel proof bottles at the time, I was expecting full on blasts of flavor from everything I was trying and not appreciating anything else. After that brief spell wore off something amazing happened: I grew up...at least as a whiskey drinker (my wife would probably tell you otherwise in any other regard). I was fortunate to find a bottle of the 2013 release and actually spend some time with it. Now, I look forward to each pour just so I can dig deeper into its complexity. If you’re relatively new to whiskey, be sure to drink this sparingly. Save the lot of it for when you’ve been able to try a good variety and can begin to appreciate balance and complexity as much as in-your-face flavor. Those who may have sampled only a few whiskeys before this one may not find this all that exciting, so keep that in mind if you happen to find any.",Nick,5,4,5,4.5,4.5,4.5,https://www.breakingbourbon.com/review/sazerac-18-year-rye-2013-release
In Depth Review,Sazerac 18 Year Rye 2014 Release,Classification: Straight Rye,Company: Sazerac Company Inc.,Distillery: Buffalo Trace,Released: Fall 2014,Proof: 90,Age: 18 Years,Mashbill: Undisclosed,Color:  Reddish Amber,MSRP: $80 (2014),Official Website,"The 2014 expression was bottled from 26 barrels that saw a 58.35% loss to evaporation. By our estimate there were a total of approximately 4,184 bottles released this year. This batch of Sazerac has been emptied from barrels and held in steel tanks since 2003. While there is no date on when this version will run out, it is rumored the tanks will be emptied by the end of 2015.","The first words to escape my lips when bringing the glass up to my nose were “Oh God.” The sweet aroma that this whiskey gives off is amazing. Soft subtle traces of vanilla, honey, soft grain and light wood waft out of the glass. I can’t emphasize enough how sweetly soft and subtle these aromas are for an aged rye. Unlike the majority of  the BTAC collection, Sazerac is bottled at a very manageable 90 proof, which gives it zero alcohol burn on the nose. Every time I smelled this whiskey I was transported to the early morning hours of a rickhouse in Kentucky, right after the doors are opened and the soft scent of whiskey fills your nose. Truly perfection.","When taking a sip, you’re instantly reminded that this is an aged rye you’re drinking. Flavors of subtle vanilla and light citrus mix with dry flavors of rye, aged oak, and soft leather. While wood is definitely present, I’m surprised that it’s not at the forefront and doesn’t dominate the palate like you would expect in an 18 year old rye. Yes, it’s dry and not as sweet as the nose would lead you to believe, but it’s also not spicy like you would expect from a rye. Truly just all flavor with zero alcohol present.","The finish on the Sazerac 18 Year seems to last forever. Much like the nose and palate, the finish is very subtle and understated. I tasted light traces of honey, orange, and peach bubblegum, mixed elegantly with subtle hints of soft rye and lightly toasted wood. This may sound like a strange pairing of flavors, however they’re truly elegant together and bring one of the most enjoyable finishes I’ve had in a long time.","The last great rye I tasted that was this good was, drum roll please….BTAC 2013 Sazerac. Seeing as how the BTAC Sazerac line was removed from the barrels in 2003 and put into stainless steel tanks to prevent further aging, this makes sense. Since then, Buffalo Trace has been drawing down from this supply while waiting for more to come of age.  So, you’re drinking a near identical whiskey year over year since it was tanked.

High aged ryes are rare and those that aren’t overly woody are even rarer. While the Van Winkle Rye is almost equally as delicious, it’s only aged 13 years vs the Sazerac’s 18. To be able to age in the barrel for another 5 years and still equally compete with a perfectly aged 13 year rye is pretty special in my book. I’m really looking forward to seeing what the next iteration of Sazerac tastes like after Buffalo Trace finishes off the current batch from the steel tanks. While I have high hopes that BT can match what they’re currently bottling, they’ve set the standards pretty high for themselves to equal the last 11 year run of Sazerac.","You’re hard pressed to find another rye, let alone another bourbon that will be better than Sazerac for the price. This could easily command double the price tag for a bottle and still be considered a good value due to the well balanced rye Buffalo Trace has put together. While it may be hard to find in the stores, I’d highly recommend buying a bottle if you ever get the opportunity. I'd even recommend shelling out more than you normally would for a glass of this at your favorite bourbon bar.",The next rye to come around that beats out this batch of Sazerac will truly be phenomenal because Buffalo Trace set the bar high with this world class rye.,"People often forget how great a consistent product is as the years go on. I feel that this is the case for Sazerac. Sure, it’s always a contender when talking about great ryes, but to think that BT has been able to offer virtually the same fantastic bottling for the past 11 years is mind blowing!

Sazerac won’t wow you with intense heat like Thomas Handy, nor will it slam flavors in your face like George T. Stagg. Instead, it will offer you a smooth mellow sip that focuses on subtle soft flavors that are sure to please. As long as you know this before drinking a glass, I think you’ll be treated to the same awesome experience that I had when reviewing this whiskey.",Jordan,5,4,5,4,5,4.5,https://www.breakingbourbon.com/review/sazerac-18-year-rye-2014-release
In Depth Review,Stagg Jr. Bourbon - Batch 12,Classification: Straight Bourbon,Company: Sazerac Company Inc.,Distillery: Buffalo Trace,Release Date: Summer 2019 / Ongoing,Proof: 132.3,Age: NAS,Mashbill: Undisclosed,Color: Molasses,MSRP: $60 (2019),Official Website,"Stagg Jr. was first announced in 2013, and with its junior designation it was expected to be a more widely available version of its counterpart released annually as part of the Buffalo Trace Antique Collection, George T. Stagg. Initially, some commented that it seemed closer to a barrel proof version of Buffalo Trace Bourbon than the original George T. Stagg. Yet, it quickly gained the attention of enthusiasts as it capitalized on the growing popularity of the Stagg name and barrel proof bourbons in general. Despite its explosive start and instant hard-to-find status, the initial batch was far from a home run. It was not a George T. Stagg substitute or even a big boy version of Buffalo Trace Bourbon that everyone hoped it would be. Instead, it was too big, too bold, and too brash. In our review, Nick called it, “a hot mess” and “couldn’t find enjoyment with it.” Since its release in fall 2013, there have been 12 batches released to date and its age is believed to hover between 7-9 years old.","A nicely constructed aroma of molasses, brown sugar, and nutmeg. As the nose opens up, cherry and honey notes develop and beautifully entwine with the heavier darker scents. It’s robust without being punchy, and its richness is superb.","For its high proof, this is an amazingly tempered sip. The palate is packed with flavor and this is a rare occurrence in which the proof doesn’t get in its way. In fact, it's the other way around. Notes of vanilla, caramel, chocolate, brown sugar, and molasses come in like a freight train, nicely balanced, yet forceful, and muting some of the proof’s heat. Overall excellent.","The palate seamlessly transitions into the finish and crescendos with a burst of tasty brown sugar fueled heat. It’s a welcomed heat as it nicely punctuates the flavor journey this bourbon takes you on. A very minor bitter note tries to intrude, but gets quickly drowned out in a delicious wash of rich seasoned oak and vanilla slurry.","The original George T. Stagg has always featured a one-of-a-kind flavor profile that makes it taste distinctly “Stagg.” With Stagg Jr., Buffalo Trace didn’t seem to set out to replicate this flavor profiles despite the bottle’s namesake. Instead, I’ve found it more closely mimics Buffalo Trace Bourbon’s profile except at a sky-high proof (in the range of 126.4-134.4). This of course brings with it all of the flavor intensity one would expect, and particularly with some previous batches, an emphasis on heat over flavor.

Generally, many Stagg Jr. batches haven’t necessarily strayed too far from other barrel proof flavor profiles on the market. Tasting blind, there hasn’t been a lot to make Stagg Jr. stand out besides its intense heat. Buffalo Trace has slowly rectified this over the years. Batch 12 doesn’t wow you with unique flavors, but with flavor intensity, balance, and its syrupy richness. This is a crowd pleaser of savory flavors that many bourbons try to reach, but few achieve to this impressive degree.","Stagg Jr. has more or less maintained its price point over the past six years. When found without markup, its price generally swings between $55-$65. This keeps it comparable with Elijah Craig Barrel Proof, Old Forester 1920 Prohibition Style, and drastically less than Booker’s Bourbon and Barrell Bourbon’s batches.

Disregarding the wide and unruly range of craft barrel proof bourbons, there are also the price outliers, the sub-$50 Old Ezra Barrel Strength and 1792 Full Proof (basically barrel proof), and over $100 Woodford Reserve Batch Proof. Clearly all barrel proof bourbons aren’t created equal and marketing has a lot to do with companies pricing their bourbons.

At least with Stagg Jr. Batch 12’s case, what its competitors price their products at isn’t the true gauge to judge Batch 12’s value. Instead, this particular batch to so well crafted, it could easily justify a high price, but at MSRP, this is a no brainer. This is a steal at $60",Stagg Jr. finally lives up to its namesake and even goes beyond; it manages to upstage this year’s George T. Stagg release.,"Buffalo Trace has been playing damage control ever since the first impression the inaugural batch of Stagg Jr. made, which very literally left a bad taste in your mouth. This doesn’t come as a surprise as the company has a knack for fine tuning their products. Availability is often spotty, but surprisingly, it does show up from time to time on store shelves. This of course is all the more noteworthy coming from the distillery known for its hefty allocation.

This latest batch of Stagg Jr. is an amazing comeback story. One where bourbon drinkers knew the potential the brand had, yet were continually given unworthy candidates. It’s been six years and 12 batches later, and Buffalo Trace appears to have managed to fine tune this release and it now proudly lives up to its namesake - at least for this release. Stagg Jr. may forever live in the shadow of George T. Stagg, but that doesn’t mean it's a poor alternative. At its price, drastically improved flavor profile, and availability - both on store shelves and at bars - it's a more than a worthwhile pour, its a must have.",Eric,4.5,4.5,4.5,3,4,4.5,https://www.breakingbourbon.com/review/stagg-jr-bourbon-batch-12
In Depth Review,Thomas H. Handy 2013 Release,Classification: Rye,Company: Sazerac Company Inc.,Distillery: Buffalo Trace,Released: Fall 2013,Proof: 128.4,Age: 6 Years,Mashbill: Undisclosed,Color:  Copper,MSRP: $70 (2013),Official Website,,"I can feel the alcohol burning my nostrils, but fruit and citrus aromas emerge beyond the initial sting.","Spicy cinnamon, caramel, and maple syrup are followed by a sweet kick with intense fruit - raisins, plums, and apricots. There is quite a bit of wonderful, flavorful punch here.",A long lingering spicy-sweetness with a hint of black licorice. Leaves me wanting to take another sip every time.,"For me this is really a great whiskey and stands somewhat on its own. As an annual release with an estimated production of 8,440 bottles this year it’s certainly limited even if it is the easiest of the Antique Collection to find. Considering what’s on your liquor store’s shelves, there is very little, if anything to choose from in the barrel proof rye category. Not only that, the whiskey itself is delicious with few flavor profile comparable. Although some might disagree with me, the closest that comes to mind is Blanton’s Single Barrel, with the Blanton’s tasting like an extremely watered down version of this when sipped side by side. Specifically, the fruit and raisin elements are what I find to be similar between the two, while the spice elements are all but lost with the Blanton’s.","At $70 a bottle it better be good. It’s not just good: it’s great. Also, it’s rare. This is absolutely worth picking up if the flavor profile is to your liking and you’re lucky enough to find a bottle. Act quickly though, you won’t see this on the shelf for long.","Bold, Rich, Spicy, Fruity, Awesome","Wow! At only 6 years old and barrel proof this bold and youthful rye packs a spicy punch, yet it’s smooth enough to drink neat. I found myself savoring every sip of this and wanting another pour once I was finished. This one doesn’t hold back as the intensity and depth of flavor are anything but subtle. This is truly a remarkable whiskey, and I would highly recommend it to anyone who appreciates a rich, sweet, higher proof whiskey and isn’t afraid of a little spice.",Nick,3,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,https://www.breakingbourbon.com/review/thomas-h-handy-2013-release
In Depth Review,William Larue Weller 2013 Release,Classification: Straight Bourbon,Company: Sazerac Company Inc.,Distillery: Buffalo Trace,Released: Fall 2013,Proof: 136.3,"Age: 12 Year, 1 Months",Mashbill: Undisclosed,Color:  Mahogany,MSRP: $70 (2013),Official Website,,The strong alcohol smell is quickly overtaken by an intense wood scent. The sweet wheat aroma is accompanied by hints of orange and minor hints of maple and caramel.,"Aggressive. Although that is to be expected of a 136 proof bourbon, but what’s surprising is its less than expected burn. An intense load of flavors hits your tongue at first sip: so much so, it’s almost hard to pick it apart. This rich flavor isn’t overpowered by the alcohol, but rather it overpowers the alcohol. There are so many flavors that hit your tongue all at once that it can be a shock. It opens with caramel, honey and butterscotch, but quickly gives way to its oaky foundation with hints of tobacco.",Long. Very long. Rich and complex flavors swirl with wood being the easiest to name first. The burn has a way of lingering much like the flavors do. Even the smallest of sips pack a flavor punch. Deep profile indeed.,"William Larue Weller is in the top ranks for uniqueness. A barrel proof wheater is a rarity in today’s bourbon landscape. Few companies make wheat based bourbon, let along a barrel proof version. With Pappy Van Winkle being the commercial success it is, it’s a surprise more distillers haven’t announce plans to expand into the wheat game. It will be interesting to see how long Buffalo Trace can maintain its levels of wheated bourbon. With currently Weller Special Reserve, Weller Antique 107, Weller 12 yr, the Van Winkle line (10 yr, 12 yr, 15 yr, 20 yr and soon 23 yr) that’s a lot of bourbon that all share the same basic mashbill. That being said, the Weller might not be as sophisticated in its palate as the Pappy line, but it makes up for it in flavor shock value.","With William Larue Weller being a barrel proof version of Weller 12 yr at 3 ½ times the price, is it a good value? A mere five years ago you would have gotten a collective “No.” Now with ever rising demand versus supply issues and an inflation of bourbon prices across the board, the answer changes to yes, this is a good value. There is very little on the shelves that it can be compared to, both in what it is and how it tastes.","A big, bold, flavorful, fantastic wheated bourbon.","This bourbon could be classified under professional level. A better understanding of the bourbon landscape, Buffalo Trace’s wheated bourbon line and a developed palate all help make William Larue Weller a fascinating bourbon to drink. Of course anyone can have fun drinking this one, but that extra layer of knowledge brings with it additional reasons to notice it.",Eric,5,4.5,4.5,5,4.5,4.5,https://www.breakingbourbon.com/review/william-larue-weller-2013-release
In Depth Review,William Larue Weller 2014 Release,Classification: Straight Bourbon,Company: Sazerac Company Inc.,Distillery: Buffalo Trace,Released: Fall 2014,Proof: 140.2,"Age: 12 Year, 3 Months",Mashbill: Undisclosed,Color:  Mahogany,MSRP: $80 (2014),Official Website,"The 2014 expression was bottled from 39 barrels that saw a 62.3% loss to evaporation, totaling by our estimate, only 3,933 bottles released this year.","At 140.2 proof, the nose surprisingly has a lack of alcohol scent to it. Instead, it has wonderful sweet notes of vanilla, caramel, confectionery sugar and fried dough, which are all in full force here. It may not have the most unique scented nose, but it’s amazingly rich and pleasant.","Dark fruit, toasted oak, cinnamon, pecan, smoke and brown sugar. The palate isn’t as broad as it’s deep. There are more complementary flavors this year and those flavors have a good amount of depth to them. This more focused range of flavors helps make this year’s WLW very balanced and tight.","The thick, syrupy and deliciously rich body of this year’s WLW finishes exactly the way it should: with a perfect length, amount of heat and flavor that trails off elegantly. The toasted oak flavors last throughout the finish, but this year they’re better balanced with the rest of the palate’s flavors.","One could say that in a year that also saw two other barrel proof wheat whiskeys hit the market, WLW isn’t quite as unique as it once was. Lets keep in mind that both Marker’s Mark Cask Strength (at 113 proof) and Parker’s Heritage Wheat Whiskey (a one-off release) are new products that don’t have the years of refinement the WLW brand has. While both of the aforementioned whiskeys were fantastic this year, the 2014 edition of WLW is still the top dog. There isn’t anything on the market that is as rich and bold as William Larue Weller. Other barrel proofers like Elijah Craig and George T. Stagg might be in the running, but nothing can match WLW’s sweet and robust flavors.","Even with a $10 increase this year, Buffalo Trace Antique Collection is a bargain in the premium bourbon field. Where Sazerac 18 Year is one of the pinnacles of rye whiskey, WLW is at the top of not only the wheated category, but also of all bourbon. There were a lot of bourbons increasing in price this year, especially in the premium category. Many of those limited releases cost upwards of $150 or more. Would I feel ripped off if I paid those prices for WLW? Not at all. This is one of the few bourbons that is worth a premium asking price.","Bold, rich and worth every penny.","Another year and another fantastic edition of WLW. Despite being higher proof than last year, I find it has less burn. While last year’s edition had a more diverse and complex palate, this year’s bottle tames its oak flavors and allows its compatible flavor components to mingle better together. The result is a WLW that lacks the intense spikes in flavor of previous years but is better balanced because of it. Ultimately it comes down to personal preference which year’s edition is “best.” Of course, if you can get your hands on a bottle of WLW you’re the real winner.",Eric,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,5,4.5,https://www.breakingbourbon.com/review/william-larue-weller-2014-release
,Barrell Bourbon Batch 005,Classification: Straight Bourbon,Company: Barrell Craft Spirits,Distillery: Sourced (From an undisclosed distillery in Tennessee),Released: August 2015,Proof: 124.7,"Age: 8 Years, 3 Months","Mashbill: 70% Corn, 26% Rye, 4% Malted Barley",Color:  Rose Gold,MSRP: $90 (2017),Official Website,"Barrell Bourbon is sourced bourbon released periodically in sequentially numbered batches. The company’s mantra is to seek out unique whiskeys and release them at barrel proof, striving to offer no two batches that are alike.

This particular batch has a mash bill of 70% corn, 26% rye, and 4% malted barley. The bottle in review is from Batch 005, bottle number 4444.","Subtle yet youthful with a slight burn, though less than expected considering the proof. Corn is most prevalent, with hints of caramel, vanilla, cinnamon, and burnt wood fighting vigorously to pull through. The scents are good, just surprising weak overall.","Cinnamon sticks and burnt brown sugar take the forefront. Nestled behind them are peaches, seasoned oak, kettle corn, and a noticeable pop of Atomic Fireball candy. It coats the mouth completely with a viscous mouthfeel. Overall well-rounded with a perfect amount of burn, though still approachable for the proof. It’s quite enjoyable and has a lively and youthful pep.","Long lasting and quite delicious. Seasoned oak becomes more prevalent here giving the first inclination towards the eight-plus years spent in the barrel. Cinnamon spice lingers unobtrusively, balanced by a dollop of sugary sweetness which dissipates in unison with the cinnamon spice and oak. An outstanding finish overall.","Joe Beatrice, the company’s founder, has made it the company’s mantra to provide a unique and different bourbon with every barrel proof batch. While this is the only batch I’ve sampled, I can say it’s unique tasting relative to other bourbons I’ve had. The company claims it is their “...spiciest batch yet,” and with a 26% rye mash bill, it’s no surprise that spice plays the lead role in this bourbon’s cast of flavors. Combined with a 124.7 proof and youthful pep, this bourbon provides a full-flavored, spice-focused, and long lasting sip that will be certain to excite the taste buds of those who experience it. In fact, it’s so spice-forward some might even consider more characteristic of a rye than a traditional bourbon.

An interesting aspect of Barrell Bourbon is the concept of offering every batch at barrel proof. This creates a challenge for the company, as water is sometimes necessary to expose the flavors behind the wood or alcohol influence. Incidentally, the bourbon community is thirsty for barrel proof offerings and Barrell Bourbon’s concept is appealing, at least for now. With that in mind, Batch 005 takes a splash of water quite well, taming the spice a bit while still allowing the rich flavors to shine."," $90 for a barrel proof bourbon falls in the higher range of barrel proof bourbons available today. Maker’s Mark Cask Strength, Stagg Jr.,Booker’s, and Elijah Craig Barrel Proof are popular options that all retail for less, though production numbers are presumably higher than Barrell. Private selections are often barrel proof, and typically range from $50-$80 though consistency and availability vary. On the flip side Angel’s Envy Cask Strength MSRPs for around $170.

E.H. Taylor Barrel Proof provides a good price point comparison, coming in about the same as Barrell Bourbon. Incidentally, the prices on both Barrell and Taylor both seem to fluctuate from mid the $60s to around $90 or so depending on the retailer. Taylor has also become quite difficult to find, popping up only once or twice a year and vanishing quite quickly thereafter. Barrell is released in one-off batches, and it does seem to require a bit of searching to locate a bottle, though it’s not impossible.

While some may take issue with the fact that Barrell Bourbon is sourced, the quality is present in the final product and the company has been willing to share what they can about each batch’s origin. For me, it’s both delicious and unique tasting, traits that multiply the enjoyment, and value, of a bourbon when found together. While I would not call it a great value as I might with some of the other barrel proof offerings, I wouldn’t call it overpriced in today’s market either. It’s fairly priced for what it is, and I’d wager that future batches will occupy shelf space long enough for those who want a bottle to have a good shot at seeking one out, though highly-praised batches will likely move from shelves very quickly.",Barrell Bourbon’s unique Batch 005 delivers a spicy and long lasting experience with enough pep to excite the taste buds of those who get an opportunity to experience it.,"I’ve found myself somewhat disappointed with many new releases lately, but was pleasantly surprised by Barrell Bourbon Batch 005. A blast of cinnamon spice, a great mouthfeel, and wholly different overall flavor profile than I had expected have successfully landed Barrell Bourbon on my radar. Combined with a fair price this one is worth seeking out while it’s still available, though that window is quickly closing.

One point of great interest to me is the company’s concept of marketing Barrel Bourbon as a completely different bourbon with each batch. While batches appear to have been well-received so far, it’s unclear if this concept has staying power for the long haul, as the possibility of a few poorly received individual batches could send consumer sentiment of the brand into a tailspin. While I cannot speak to the quality or flavor characteristics of other batches, this one has piqued my interest and I’m quite curious to see how this concept unfolds over time. If we can rely on the folks at Barrell Bourbon to consistently deliver unique batches of similar quality as this one, count me in. Batch 005 is, without question, one of my favorites of the year.

,Barrell Bourbon Batch 011,Classification: Straight Bourbon,Company: Barrell Craft Spirits,Distillery: Sourced (From an undisclosed distillery in Tennessee),Released: March 2017,Proof: 114.8,Age: 6 Years,"Mashbill: 70% Corn, 25% Rye, 5% Malted Barley",Color:  Deep Golden Honey,MSRP: $90,Official Website,"Barrell Bourbon is sourced bourbon released periodically in sequentially numbered batches. The company’s mantra is to seek out unique whiskeys and release them at barrel proof, striving to offer no two batches that are alike.

According to the company’s website, “Barrell Bourbon Batch 011 is the culmination of a 2 year long barrel sorting project focused on highlighting a particularly rare and bright flavor note found in only select barrels of bourbon.The base of this blend is 6-year-old barrels but it contains older barrels as well.” Barrell Bourbon Batch 011 took first place for best bourbon in the 2017 San Francisco World Spirits Competition.","Prominent scents of candy corn and buttered cornbread invite a deeper inhale. Breathing in more intensely, the proof is apparent, but hints of ripe bananas and citrus come with it. It’s quite manageable for the proof, enticing you to have a taste.","Describing it as an explosion of flavor almost doesn’t do it justice. Caramel sweetness is balanced against warming cinnamon spice. Rich cornbread, cotton candy, sweet corn, and seasoned oak layer in complexity and depth. There’s a ton of flavor here, and it’s diverse in its delivery. It’s as if you can taste something different every time. Batch 011 is creamy, mouth-coating, and perfectly proofed.","Crisp and clean, the cinnamon spice from the palate dissipates quickly leaving sweet notes of candy corn, a bit of seasoned oak, and echoes of the flavors from the palate. While not the neverending finish you might anticipate from such an explosion of flavor found in the palate, not to mention its high proof, the shorter than expected conclusion leaves you wanting to take another sip.","Each batch of Barrell Bourbon is unique by design. While Barrell Craft Spirits is in the process of getting their own distillation operation up and running, it will be years before they can introduce it into the mix. As a result, the bourbon that makes up each batch is sourced.

The company is forthright with much of the information on the spirits they source for each batch, which includes the state of distillation, age, and mashbill in most cases. Because of this, just visiting the company’s website will tell you that out of 13 batches of bourbon released to date (this includes the 007B and 008B batches), many share similarities. Comparing them with Batch 011, 10 out of 13 were also distilled in Tennessee, with 7 of those sharing the same mashbill. The ages of bourbons sourced from Tennessee range from 5 to 13 years old, with all but one under 10 years.

On the surface you might think the “every batch is unique concept” is just marketing. I’ve challenged the idea myself. But compared to the industry as a whole, it’s not uncommon to see many very different products stem from the same distillery and mashbill. The effects of barrel aging, barrel selection, and ultimately the final blend and bottling proof make one bourbon distinct from another. Just compare standard Maker’s Mark with Maker’s Cask Strength; these are two very different experiences separated by the addition of water alone.

My point is, while many of Barrell’s sourced bourbons share some underlying similarities, the final experience can vary drastically from one to the next. Batch 011 is a perfect example of this. The culmination of a 2 year long barrel sorting project focused on highlighting exceptional barrels, it’s apparent that Batch 011 shines. I’ve enjoyed every batch of Barrell Bourbon that I’ve tasted so far. Batch 011’s explosive and bright flavors make it a standout, not just among Barrell products, but among bourbons at large.","Barrell Bourbon is priced at a premium; $90 MSRP, though it can often be found for less. Given the fact that each batch is released in fairly limited numbers and at barrel proof, this makes up a bit for the relatively low age of some of the batches, this one included. That said, if the taste is right maybe we can let some of the technicals slide a bit. Barrell nails it with Batch 011, making it worth every penny. If you plan to buy act quickly though, as this bourbon took first place at the 2017 San Francisco World Spirits Competition and is sure to be swept off the shelves more quickly than usual.","An explosion of flavors, the Barrell team showcases their ability to source and blend a fantastic bourbon with Batch 011.An explosion of flavors, the Barrell team showcases their ability to source and blend a fantastic bourbon with Batch 011.","I’ve reviewed a number of Barrell bourbons and enjoyed every one. In fact I chose batches 005 and 006 as some of my favorite whiskeys of 2015 and 2016, respectively. In my discussions with Joe Beatrice, the company’s founder, he and his team put a lot of care into selecting and blending the barrels for each batch. Barrell is a company to watch, as Beatrice along with master distiller Tripp Stimson are on fire, producing some of the best bourbons on the market today. If you enjoy barrel proof bourbon with a lot of flavor, be sure to pick up a bottle of Batch 011 before it’s too late.

In Depth Review,Barrell Dovetail,"Classification: Whiskey Finished in Rum, Port & Dunn Vineyards Cabernet Barrels",Company: Barrell Craft Spirits,Distillery: Undisclosed distilleries in Indiana and Tennessee,Released: December 2018,Proof: 122.9,"Age: NAS (Blend of 10 year old whiskey distilled in Indiana, finished in Dunn Vineyards Cabernet barrels and 11 year old bourbon distilled in Tennessee finished in black strap rum casks and LBV Port Pipes)",Mashbill: Undisclosed,Color:  Dark Gold,MSRP: $80 (2019),Official Website,"Dovetail was released under the Barrell Whiskey line, though it was titled “Dovetail” instead of being given a batch number. Barrell Whiskey represents some of the company’s most experimental blends, with various underlying whiskeys and combinations of finishing barrels comprising each unique batch. Dovetail follows Barrell Whiskey Batch 005, and according to the company took nearly a year to perfect.",Sweet robust aromas of candied raisins and molasses are present along with a hint of anise. A touch of heat shows evidence of the proof. It’s intriguing and pleasant.,"The sip opens with cane sugar, molasses, and dark cherries - a pleasing combination of sweet, rich flavors. A touch of barrel char along with toasted marshmallows also come into play, countering the sweeter notes. Mouth-coating and noticeably robust, yet not harsh, the palate is a well-developed layering of flavors that’s as satisfying as it is unique.","Peppery spice kicks in at first, along with a touch of heat. Sweet sugar and toasted marshmallows follow, along with an essense of dark fruit. Long and warming it leaves a delicious aftertaste inviting another sip.","The folks at Barrell continue to impress me time and time again. The first few whiskeys in the Barrell Whiskey line were good, but not whiskeys I felt I would often come back to. With Whiskey Batch 004 a strong rum influence was introduced, and I really liked it. Here with Dovetail, they’ve pulled back on the rum finish in favor of balance, mingling whiskey finished in Cabernet barrels and bourbon finished in LBV Port Pipes and rum casks. LBV meaning “Late Bottled Vintage,” and pipes being essentially long barrels with tapered ends, the result is a layered and rich flavor profile, with an err towards the sweeter side. Barrell succeeds in finding new combination for finishing, yet keeps the resulting flavor profile in check - a result I think many will find appealing and, surprisingly, less polarizing than finished whiskeys can sometimes be.","Barrell’s pricing remains in premium territory, and as a result I never consider it a value play in the same sense as a good whiskey under $30 can be. Instead, take a step back and look at the end product. It’s uniquely crafted, unique tasting, barrel proof, and delicious. Unlike many non-distiller producer (NDP) brands which simply seek out quality bourbon, Barrell adds unique aspects to the mix. Joe Beatrice, the company’s founder, has never told me he simply seeks out the best barrels (and keep in mind he is often sourcing from the same distilleries as other NDPs). Instead, the conversation is about the blending. The next experiment. Getting it just right. Like I said, I haven’t loved every Barrell Whiskey release, but this one nails it giving us an end product unlike any other. For that reason it’s well worth the asking price, even if it is in premium territory.",Barrell Craft Spirits continues to impress with a whiskey release layered in flavors that’s as satisfying as it is unique.,"Finished whiskeys can be some of the most polarizing on the market, and that’s always the risk with trying something different. Barrell succeeds with Dovetail, delivering a unique tasting whiskey that’s not too far off the standard whiskey flavor spectrum that it turns people away. While the talk lately has been focused on Barrell’s new high end BCS line, which is fantastic by the way, I’d argue that Dovetail is just as good in its own right and much more accessible. If you’re a Barrell fan interested in exploring something a little different, then this is one to definitely seek out.",Nick,3,4,4,4,3,4,https://www.breakingbourbon.com/review/barrell-dovetail
In Depth Review,Big Bottom Single Barrel,Classification: Straight Bourbon,Company: Big Bottom,Distillery: Midwest Grain Products Ingredients (MGPI),Released: October 2013 / Ongoing,Proof: 111,Age: 6 Years,,Color:  Copper,MSRP: $40 (2016),Official Website,"Single Barrel; Big Bottom is an Oregon based independent bottler that bottles bourbon produced by MGP of Indiana. It's currently only in very limited distribution in select U.S. states. According to Big Bottom, this bourbon was aged over 6 years in new white oak. But, Big Bottom didn’t open their warehouses until 2010.  So, this bourbon must have spent some time aging in Indiana and some time aging in Oregon.","Light traces of cinnamon and raisin. An alcohol burn is definitely present, but not overpowering.","Dried cherries fill your mouth instantly and then the palate mellows out into a mixture of peppery citrus and orange peels. Big Bottom presented me with a really interesting taste. I can’t recall ever tasting anything quite like this. It fills your mouth with a slight burn up front, but at 111 proof, the warmth is expected and appreciated. The palate stays with you for a while, allowing you to really enjoy the taste of this bourbon. For such a high proof, it’s very drinkable without adding any water. That being said, after adding a few drops of water, the nose didn’t change. But, with the water, the palate morphs into a nice spicy bourbon with stronger hints of pepper & citrus. Unfortunately, that delicious dried cherry taste vanished. I’d recommend trying it straight before diluting it to taste so that you can experience that unique dried cherry flavor.","The finish on this bourbon is long and mellow. The fruit and citrus of the palate adds a very slight new wood taste in the finish, with something else lingering in the background.  Each time I took a sip, I got a consistent palate, but I kept trying to chase that lingering background taste for those additional slight flavors.

Adding a few drops of water cleared the finish right up. The bourbon retained that new wood flavor, but a distinct and very mellow nut flavor came into play. It was subtle, more along the lines of plain walnuts mixed with a few almonds, but definitely present.","While they may not make their own bourbon, Big Bottom has done a fantastic job of bottling this bourbon just at the right time. You get a really interesting bourbon that makes you ponder what’s going on with every sip.

I do wish Big Bottom would provide more information on this product, as I’m really interested to know how long this was aged in Indiana versus in their own aging warehouse in Oregon.  I'd also like to know what effect the weather of the Pacific Northwest had on the aging process.","For $40 this is a great deal. Sure Big Bottom isn’t distilling their own bourbon, but they pulled this barrel at just the right time to bottle. Having discovered this bourbon for the first time in Portland, I’m glad that I took a chance on this little gem. Still in very limited distribution throughout the US, I would highly recommend picking up a bottle if you can find one.",A really interesting bourbon that makes you ponder what’s going on with every sip.,"A great bourbon that left me yearning to try more of Big Bottom’s products. Shame that the distribution is so limited, as this single barrel proves to be a great value in my book! I’ll be interested to see how their future products that were 100% aged in Oregon turn out a few years down the road.",Jordan,2.5,4,3.5,3,4.5,4,https://www.breakingbourbon.com/review/big-bottom-single-barrel
,Blanton's Gold Edition,Classification: Straight Bourbon,"Company: Sazerac Comapny Inc., Blanton's Distilling Company",Distillery: Buffalo Trace,Released: Ongoing,Proof: 103,Age: NAS,Mashbill: Undisclosed,Color:  Copper,MSRP: $85 (2016),Official Website,This barrel of Blanton’s Gold Edition was dumped on 11-12-12 from Barrel No. 118. It was stored in Warehouse H on Rick No. 20. The registered Bottle No. is 176. It is currently only offered in international markets and in some domestic duty free stores. This bourbon was bottled specially for sale in the U.K. and is only sold in 700ml bottles.,"In a word, delicious. Raisins, dried fruit, citrus, and fresh hay shine through. This higher proof version of Blanton’s contains a slight increase in the noticeable alcohol scent on the nose versus the Original Single Barrel Blanton’s, while still offering a delicious refined smelling bourbon. It’s amazing how much of a difference an increase in 10 proof points makes in rounding out a fuller bodied nose.","The palate on the Gold Edition offers a great mouthfeel and a subtle flavor profile.  Drier than I expected based on my experience with the other bottles in the Blanton’s line up, it’s marked with hints of vanilla, honey, toffee, tobacco, dried fruit, and pepper. The extra proof is more noticeable in the Gold Edition specifically with its pepper profile, which starts as a subtle spicy burn on the back end of the palate and roars up in the finish.","A lingering spice defines this bold finish. A pleasant slow burn engulfs your mouth and builds up heat as it slowly travels down your throat with each sip. Within that burn you have flavors of subtle rye, charred aged wood, leather, and honey. A dry heat stays in your mouth for a noticeable time and really prolongs the finish. I was able to “chew” on this finish for several minutes and was really able to appreciate its flavor characteristics.","Blanton’s Gold Edition is only sold to select non-U.S. markets. At 103 proof, Blanton’s Gold Edition comes in 10 proof points higher than Blanton’s Original Single Barrel that you can buy in the U.S., which is sold at 93 proof. If you enjoy Blanton’s Original Single Barrel, this is one of two opportunities to try a higher proofed version from the distillery, the other being Blanton’s Straight from the Barrel. It’s one of the few products on the market that allows you to do a side by side comparison of a brand at multiple proof points. I wish more products would do this as it allows consumers to buy the version that’s best suited for their preferred proof range.

The Gold Edition allows you to taste Blanton’s at a proof that offers full flavor without overpowering you from the increased alcohol. It’s interesting to see what just a slight increase in proof can do to really bring out the flavor profile of the Blanton’s brand. Really a shame that they make consumers go out of their way to try it, because I find the bolder flavor profile to be more well rounded than what you currently see in other Buffalo Trace single barrel products.","At nearly double the price of Blanton’s Original Single Barrel, the value of Blanton’s Gold Edition certainly lies in the eye of the beholder. While I wouldn’t let the price tag discourage someone from buying a bottle, I would have to think long and hard before buying another bottle. Don’t get me wrong, I find this to be slightly better than the Blanton’s Original Single Barrel, however due to the fact that I can get almost two bottles of Blanton’s Original Single Barrel - which is fantastic in its own right - for the price of one bottle of the Gold Edition, it makes it a trickier situation.","A slightly more “grown-up” version of Blanton’s Original Single Barrel that builds off of all the great qualities and then some, while unfortunately selling at a more grown-up price point.","This is a pretty consistent bourbon across the board when it comes to flavor profile. The nose, palate, and finish all are very pleasing and this bourbon delivers a great sip from start to finish. The Gold Edition is a slightly spunkier version of Blanton’s Original Single Barrel in the sense that it offers the same great nose, a little drier mouthfeel, and a little more burn in the finish.

Additionally, the Gold Edition is a really fun opportunity to taste a higher proof version of a beloved single barrel that you won’t often get the opportunity to have, however it comes with a hefty price tag. I actually prefer the Gold Edition over the Original version, and it’s a shame that this isn’t sold in the U.S. at slightly higher price than Blanton’s Original Single Barrel. If it were, I could see this being popular as many Blanton’s fans would gladly pay for the opportunity to try a slightly “grown-up” version of a beloved bourbon. That being said I’m not sure how many would go back for a second bottle due to the fact that while it’s slightly better, I’d be willing to bet many would be hard pressed to pick one bottle of Gold over almost two bottles of Blanton’s Original Single Barrel",Jordan,4,3,4,4,2.5,4,https://www.breakingbourbon.com/review/blantons-gold-edition
,Blanton's Single Barrel,Classification: Straight Bourbon,"Company: Sazerac Company Inc., Blanton's Distilling Company",Distillery: Buffalo Trace,Released: Ongoing,Proof: 93,Age: NAS,Mashbill: Undisclosed,Color:  Reddish Amber,MSRP: $55 (2017),Official Website,"Dumped on 3-25-2013, Bottle No 31, Warehouse H, Rick No 44",Fresh citrus wrapped in spicy caramel and vanilla. Very pleasant but subtle with little burn.,"A sweet blend of raisin, caramel, and orange coat the mouth with a soft but full amount of flavor. A little spice on the back end balances the initial sweetness. A floral hint is noticeable, but not so much so that it takes away from tasting like a true “bourbon.”","As the spice on the back end of the palate fades away, burnt sugars, caramel, and vanilla take over. This is just as pleasant as the rest of the sip and lasts a little longer than most bourbons.","Blanton’s claims to be the first and original single barrel bourbon dating back to 1984. Whether or not that’s true really doesn’t matter at this point as there are plenty of quality single barrel offerings: Colonel E.H.Taylor, Four Roses, and Eagle Rare, to name a few. There is, however, something notably different about Blanton’s flavor that makes it distinct; it’s just hard to put your finger on it.","It may just be my personal preference, but I think this is incredibly delicious bourbon and a steal at $45. There is a lot of personal preference built into that recommendation though, as it just doesn’t stand up to the two tests on paper - age and accessibility. There is no age statement on the bottle, but I’ve read 8 years is the ballpark for most. That being said, Thomas Handy is 6 years aged and flies off the shelves at $70. It’s also easily accessible. That could change, however, as demand continues to heat up. If this does become more difficult to get your hands on I have a feeling people will be scrambling to get a bottle. Entering into the $50 range also brings some steep competition: Russell’s Reserve Single Barrel, Knob Creek Single Barrel, Four Roses Single Barrel, Van Winkle Special Reserve (12 year Lot B), and so on. I think this is one you will just have to try for yourself. If you love it as I do, you’ll find the price to be more than fair.",Just plain delicious.,"Refined and delicious, but nothing special on paper. I avoided this bourbon for the longest time just simply based on the look of the bottle. I thought it was kind of gimmicky. It also looks smaller than the other 750 ml bottles, making it appear overpriced. All of that changed after I bought my first bottle and, ironically, it has become one of my favorite bottle designs. I think it’s possible that others have made the same assumptions as I had, always seeing Blanton’s on the shelf, often accumulating dust, and passing it by simply because of its “look.” Let it be known, this stuff is the real deal. For that reason, it may not always be as easy to come by as it is today.",Nick,4,4,4,3.5,3.5,4,https://www.breakingbourbon.com/review/blantons-single-barrrel
,"E.H. Taylor, Jr. Straight Rye",Classification: Straight Rye,"Company: Sazerac Company, Inc.",Distillery: Old Fashioned Copper Distillery/Buffalo Trace,Release Date: Ongoing,Proof: 100,Age: NAS,Mashbill: Undisclosed (Buffalo Trace's high rye mashbill containing rye and malted barley),Color: Mahogany,Price: $80 (2020),Official Website,"The E.H. Taylor, Jr. line contains a few staples such as Single Barrel, Small Batch, and Rye along with limited yearly releases. Unlike the others, E.H. Taylor, Jr. Rye is the only rye in the entire collection to date. Like the majority of E.H. Taylor releases, Straight Rye is Bottled-in-Bond. To be labelled Bottled-in-Bond, the whiskey must be the product of one distillation season and one distiller at a single distillery, aged in a federally bonded warehouse under U.S. government supervision for at least four years, and it must be bottled at exactly 100 proof. Additionally, the Bottled-in-Bond label must clearly identify the distillery where it was distilled and where it was bottled, if different.","A rich warming scent of toasted oak is instantly noticeable. This is unique for a rye, as oak usually isn’t the most powerful scent, simply because the majority of ongoing ryes on the market are relatively young. Rye spice, pepper, and baking spice follow, providing the typical rye notes one would expect. Interestingly, delicate scents of mint and pear are interwoven adding some freshness to the aroma. It’s an excellent nose overall that nicely balances the expected with the unexpected.","It's hard to deny the rye spice this whiskey features, as it hits hard and fast, yet quickly becomes tempered as the palate opens up. The focus then moves to vanilla, pear, nutmeg, and a dash of pine. This transition makes for an interesting sip, as too often rye whiskeys are one-dimensional. This whiskey also has an oily viscosity which coats the tongue in cinnamon and baking spice flavors. As an added bonus, the mouthfeel greatly enhances the whiskey and takes an already admirable palate to even greater heights.","A much more typical rye finish consisting of cinnamon, nutmeg, and anise. It starts a little hot, but gently fades and mellows with the help of additional oak notes. Its oily mouthfeel transitions to provide an herbal aftertaste that further mirrors the freshness found in the nose. While it may not be the highlight of the sip, its finish is effective and certainly has its moments of welcomed intensity.","While Buffalo Trace doesn’t disclose exact mashbills, we know they have two different rye mashbills. One is a low-rye mashbill that is used to make Sazerac Rye, Sazerac 18 Year, Thomas H. Handy, and Van Winkle Family Reserve Rye. The other is a high-rye mashbill that is used exclusively to make E.H. Taylor Rye. With the high-rye mashbill omitting corn, E.H. Taylor Rye is quite a bit different tasting from Buffalo Trace’s other rye products as it is much more spice forward and lacks noticeable fruit sweetness.

Although E.H. Taylor Rye doesn’t feature an age statement, its bottled in bond destination makes it at least four years old. An estimated nine years old is often thrown around, and based on how oak forward and complex it is, that might be fairly accurate. This then puts it on the short list of ryes with a similar constitution, such as Michter's Rye 10 Year and Redemption Rye 10 Year to name a few. Because  E.H. Taylor Rye leans more towards a classic rye profile, it doesn’t come across as unique tasting as ryes from WhistlePig, High West, or Barrell. And while Bulleit Rye 12 Year has an impressive age statement, it's not really in the conversation quality-wise. This ultimately puts E.H. Taylor Rye in more of a familiar territory, yet it offers just enough character to make it stand out on its own accord.","I can’t even count how many times I passed on purchasing a bottle of E.H. Taylor Rye. Despite the E.H. Taylor brand being known for its high quality floor for their standard releases, it was the Rye’s price point that was the main deterrent for me. With so many quality and interesting options under $40, I had a hard time being convinced I should spend double or sometimes even triple on a E.H. Taylor Rye.

Premium rye whiskeys in general still have a lot to prove commanding top dollar for releases (Wild Turkey Cornerstone is a good recent example of this). For one, there just aren’t many of them, and the ones that are highly rated, like Sazerac 18 Year, high aged Willetts, and Van Winkle Family Reserve, for example, are hopelessly hard to find. E.H. Taylor Rye isn’t the easiest rye to find either, but at least tends to show up from time to time. When you do see it, $80 seems like a lot, but its price is comparable to its contemporaries, such as WhistlePig, Barrell, Michter's, and Redemption. You’ll quickly find out after sipping it, $80 isn’t as big of a number as it first seems, and is actually right on the money.","E.H. Taylor Rye hits home with a classic rye profile, and fully justifies its price with unique flavor accents, mouthfeel, and excellent overall sipping quality.","With the explosion of interesting under $40 ryes on the market that are giving the premium rye category a run for its money, I had a hard time believing E.H. Taylor Rye had much to offer me that a less expensive bottle couldn’t. Even in the premium rye category where there are some solid offerings, I feel like they remain a harder sell than premium bourbons. So I wasn’t excited with the thought of dropping $80 on a rye that was perhaps marginally better, even if it was in fact a better whiskey.

Overall, I’m quite impressed by E.H. Taylor Rye. Its tempered oak and rye spice are nicely threaded throughout its sip, with a lovely mint, pear, and herbal accent, and an oily mouthfeel that’s icing on the cake. It showcases exactly what a classic rye profile whiskey is supposed to be, while adding a dash of uniqueness. Don’t miss a chance at grabbing a bottle and taking your time sipping it. This is a great rye that excels as a sipping rye where its virtues are fully on display.",Eric,4,4,3.5,3,2.5,4,https://www.breakingbourbon.com/review/e-h-taylor-jr-straight-rye
In Depth Review,Eagle Rare 17 Year 2013 Release,Classification: Straight Bourbon,Company: Sazerac Company Inc.,Distillery: Buffalo Trace,Released: Fall 2013,Proof: 90,Age: 19 Years,Mashbill: Undisclosed,Color:  Light Amber,MSRP: $70 (2013),Official Website,,"Mellow. Nothing hits you as being overpowering. There are hints of vanilla and cherries. Near the back end: oak and almond develop. It begins to open up with time, almost like a fine wine.","Mellow again. It seems like every other new bourbon on the market today is over 100 proof. At 90 proof, Eagle Rare 17 comes off as an easy drinker. Its profile is very well rounded. Its age (19 years) does provide some oak backbone, yet comes nowhere near overpowering any of the flavors. Those flavors include some minor vanilla notes, caramel, cereal, black pepper and even some raisins.","This is a 19 year old bourbon and you can taste it. For a bourbon this old, the oak rounds out the flavor profile more than it dominates it. Some of the mellowness of the oak flavor can be attributed to the 90 proof point but certainly not all: this is a carefully aged bourbon that puts a premium on balance.","A well rounded bourbon is becoming harder to come by. Gimmicks have become the new go-to in bourbon, not perfected flavor. Brands don’t strive to be well rounded, they strive to be different in the ever-growing and crowded landscape of bourbonland. Can a bourbon be unique by simply being balanced? Eagle Rare 17’s one blazingly obvious unique trait would be the bourbon’s age. That age allows more flavors to develop, blend and even hide behind other flavors. Older aged bourbons (12 years plus) are becoming a rarity in bourbon as distillers pull barrels early to meet current demand.","Is Eagle Rare 17 three times better value than any of the major brands’ entry level bourbons? Is it worth double the price of a Woodford Reserve, Russell's Reserve or Marker’s Mark? Probably not, but that solely depends on a person’s experience and palate range. Eagle Rare 17 certainly has a deeper flavor range for those who care to taste. To boil it down to a single point: any spirit aged to 19 years for $70 is a good value.","A well-rounded, mellow, oaky, gimmick-free bourbon.","Eagle Rare 17’s place in the Buffalo Trace Antique Collection always seemed like it was meant to represent what basic 90 proof bourbon should strive be. A benchmark. When you think age, you think bourbon. Eagle Rare is one of the oldest bourbon currently on the market. It’s hard to find fault in a well balanced, well rounded bourbon. What Sazerac 18 yr does for ryes, Eagle Rare does for bourbon. Check your gimmicks at the door.",Eric,4,4,4,4,4,4,https://www.breakingbourbon.com/review/eagle-rare-17-year-2013-release
,Elijah Craig 18 Year Single Barrel,Classification: Straight Bourbon,Company: Heaven Hill,Distillery: Heaven Hill,"Release Date:  Ongoing (Annual, typically 4th quarter)",Proof: 90,Age: 18 Years,"Mashbill: 78% Corn, 12% Malted Barley, 10% Rye",Color: Mahogany,Price: $150 (2020),Official Website,"Heaven Hill markets Elijah Craig 18 Year Single Barrel by asking, “Ready to experience some of the oldest Bourbon barrels in Kentucky?” Elijah Craig 18 Year and Elijah Craig 23 Year remain the stewards of high aged bourbon. With yearly releases, no other brands match Heaven Hill’s track record of continually releasing high aged bourbon. At one time Heaven Hill released 20, 21, and 22 year single barrel variants, but at the time of this review, they have been discontinued.","Warming and deliciously rich, Elijah Craig 18 Year starts off incredibly strong. Orange, chocolate, toasted oak, honey, vanilla, and custard form an aroma that leaps from the glass. Its sweetness is perfectly tempered against hearty oak notes creating an amazingly balanced nose.","Equal amounts of vanilla and oak form the palate’s foundation, with light brown sugar, caramel, and a fruit salad-like pop of sweetness joining in. The oak remains throughout, but is kept in check thanks to the palate’s fruitier side. The result is a very likable medium-bodied palate that is a crowd-pleaser at heart.","Heavy oak pulls forward during the finish and quickly overtakes many of the palate’s fruitier flavors. There’s a dankness that lingers, and while it’s not overpowering, it is quite noticeable. It doesn’t completely derail the finish, but takes an excellent bourbon down a notch.","Outside of its age statement, Elijah Craig 18 Year has always suffered from making a lasting impression. It often straddles the line between good and great, but it's rare to come across a particular bottle that’s really exciting. Elijah Craig 18 Year’s impact is also muted thanks to the continued impressive showings from Elijah Craig Barrel Proof. It doesn’t help that high proof bourbons are still very much in vogue, and the 18 Year’s 90 proof just seems lacking and a heldover relic from the past.

As a result, year after year I’ve never felt the urge to pick up this annual release. The lack of excitement surrounding the brand all but negates its impressive age statement. This seems strange as there isn’t another ongoing 18 year old bourbon on the market. Excitement somehow trumps high age statements I guess, which is too bad since I’ve missed out on a highly drinkable bourbon for many years.

Of course drinkable can mean many things to many people. Elijah Craig 18 Year isn’t going to shock anyone with a one-of-a-kind tasting palate. It’s predictable and straightforward, yet features enough complexity and enjoyable flavors to win over just about anyone. It’s typical for the grass is always greener mentality to kick in, and lose sight of a traditional style bourbon that delivers quality over flash.","When discussing Elijah Craig 18 Year, If you’ve been around bourbon long enough, it's impossible not to mention its old price for how shockingly low it used to be. Even a decade ago, many bourbon drinkers knew $50 for an 18 year old bourbon was a steal. When its price ramped up to $100, then $120, and now $150, many who knew the brand at a cheaper price had a hard time forking over the extra dough for it - even if deep down they knew it was worth it.

Now at $150, Elijah Craig 18 Year remains a good value for a bourbon of its age. The majority of limited release bourbons from major Kentucky distilleries come in between $125-$175, and the majority of them don’t include an equal or higher age statement. The 18 Year’s oak can be trying at times depending on the barrel it was pulled from, and its proof too low, but overall it’s a fairly consistent quality release that you know exactly what you're getting for your money.","Elijah Craig 18 Year may forgo uniqueness for constancy, but in return delivers an impressive age statement, good value, and drinkability.","Elijah Craig 18 Year certainly has its fans, but it's never been a bourbon that has lit the world on fire. So much of this is due to its lack of strong identity, both in its flavor profile and marketing. As a single barrel, quality can vary and Heaven Hill doesn't make a big deal about sourcing their best barrels for it. It also isn’t a carefully crafted blend like a Four Roses Limited Edition that can help drive interest to a particular release. Its bottle design had been boring for years and on the wrong side of old fashioned before its current update. This has resulted in a product that has never quite reached the fever pitch with bourbon drinkers that it probably deserves.

I’ve had Elijah Craig 18 Year over the years and though I felt it hit a consistent high quality bar, I usually wasn’t generally excited by it. While the product hasn’t drastically changed much, the market has. Bourbon is filled with gimmicks, high proof releases, flashy craft distilleries, and celebrity master distillers. Elijah Craig 18 Year is a product that isn’t any of these things and simply just is. It’s an old faithful when it comes to limited releases with its crowd-pleasing flavors, consistent high quality, impressive age statement, and decent availability for a limited release. It’s easy to be swayed by the new kid on the block, but sometimes it's worth revisiting an old friend.",Eric,4.5,4,3,3,3,4,https://www.breakingbourbon.com/review/elijah-craig-18-year-single-barrel

","A blast of rich oak, maple and caramel followed with more subtle hints of apple cinnamon and orange. It has an overall sweetness that does a good job hiding the high proof.","It welcomes you with heat and dry oak, but also mixes in some sweet caramel. It’s a blast of flavor all at once like many great barrel proofs are. Fruit notes also become more prevalent as your tongue adjusts to the initial blast of oak and heat.","It’s moderate to long flavor finishes with a spicy heat that lingers longer than any barrel proof bourbon I’ve tasted. It’s a fantastic ride of high flavor that continues to reveal more depth even in its finish.  Some amount of bitterness develops late in the game mixed in with the never-ending oak flavor. It has an amazing amount of oak flavor for a 12 year old bourbon. It makes you wonder how another bourbon could pack anymore oak flavor in than this one.
","Barrel proof bourbons are become an ever growing and popular segment of the bourbon business. The long time champion and go-to of high proofers, George T. Stagg, now has much more competition in the likes of E.H.Taylor, Booker's, Stagg Jr, William Larue Weller, 4 Roses, Blanton's and now Elijah Craig. It’s getting harder to standout in a crowded field. Elijah Craig Barrel Proof doesn’t come off as being out-of-this-world unique compared to its competition. The lack of any alcohol taste off of it and its richness of flavor standout the most. It's loaded full of flavor but it also packs a good deal of heat.","This is where it gets really interesting. Almost every barrel proof bourbon on the market is priced over $50. The ones close to that amount, Stagg Jr. and Bookers, are generally seen as the least desirable and lowest rated of the barrel proof bourbons. Elijah Craig started off retailing for $35 (it has since climbed to $40-$45). It would be a mistake to look at its price and perceive it as being an inferior product based on it being almost half the price of its competition. It doesn’t take a professional bourbon critic to tell you that simply isn’t true with this one. Elijah Craig Barrel Proof is hands down the best deal in bourbon.","Big bold flavor combined with great value and quality, leaves many barrel proof bourbon in its dust.","It’s really a simple equation: Great flavor + great price = must buy. This is a quality barrel proof bourbon with fantastic flavor. It's so packed with flavor it makes you feel guilty buying it for the price Heaven Hill is charging. It’s a top tier barrel proof bourbon that deserves to be experienced. If Heaven Hill can ever catch up with demand on this one and make it more readily available, watch out. It could send shock waves through the barrel proof bourbon market.",Eric,4,4,4.5,3,4,4,https://www.breakingbourbon.com/review/elijah-craig-barrel-proof

Because it's barrel proof, the proof varies from batch to batch. To help identify each batch, in 2017 Heaven Hill started adding batch information to each bottle. The first letter of the batch number indicates which of that year's releases the bottle was a part of starting with “A,” while the second digit is a number that determines the month of the year the bottle was released. The third and fourth digits indicate the year. The bottle being reviewed is from the second batch that was released May 2020.","A burst of sweet caramel and graham cracker is complemented nicely by aged oak. Rich and delightful, the aromas form a near perfect balance. Despite the bourbon’s high proof, ethanol doesn’t impede any of the scents found in this very enjoyable nose.","Toasted marshmallows mingle with charred oak, caramel, and a sweet burnt brown sugar note. The bourbon has a heavy body with a robust underlying structure, reminding you that it’s barrel proof yet allowing the flavors to rise above the proof. This trait helps set it apart from many other high proof bourbons that struggle against their naturally-infused heat.","An initial rush of spice is followed by more depth - tobacco, leather, and again aged oak. The finish is long and warming, with the spicy-sweet combination leaving a superb lasting impression.","Since Elijah Craig Barrel Proof’s introduction to market in 2013, barrel proof bourbons have become increasingly popular. For a time, its 12 year age statement was also quite unique, however we have seen a surge of high aged bourbons in the 12 - 14 year range released lately, many from Tennessee.

I find that unlike similarly aged high proof Tennessee bourbons, Elijah Craig maintains a more quintessential bourbon flavor profile, which at barrel proof is like blasting a stereo on full volume. However, unlike the boisterous in-your-face trait barrel proof bourbons sometimes take on, Elijah Craig Batch B520 keeps the potency in check, instead focusing on a rich, full-flavored experience.","Heaven Hill is known for maintaining a high quality to price ratio, ultimately hitting high on the value scale. While the company has changed up a number of their high value products to realign with the rest of the market, Elijah Craig Barrel Proof has maintained its relatively high value right from day one. It has stayed within the price range of readily-available barrel proof bourbons from other major Kentucky distilleries such as Maker’s Mark Cask Strength and Stagg, Jr. (exceedingly less readily-available in many areas). However, Elijah Craig Barrel Proof pricing falls well below many similarly or slightly higher aged barrel proof bourbons that we have seen popping up lately, many of which are sourced from Tennessee. Elijah Craig’s combination of age, high proof, and ultimately quality make it a fantastic deal at $65.","Now in its 7th year, Elijah Craig Barrel Proof maintains its exceptional quality with an impressive showing from the latest Batch B520.","When Elijah Craig Barrel Proof was first released in March 2013, it was met with a warm reception, and over the years has accumulated numerous accolades. With three batches released annually, B520 is the brand's 23rd batch release, and the second of three slated for 2020. Since the first release, Heaven Hill has maintained the 12 year age statement, approximate price point, and most importantly overall quality. Batch B520 hits all the right marks for the brand, and while the quality is consistent from batch to batch, it makes for one of the better showings. Considering its price point, availability, and overall quality, Batch B520 is undoubtedly an early contender as one of my favorite whiskeys of 2020.",Nick,4,4,4,3,4,4,https://www.breakingbourbon.com/review/elijah-craig-barrel-proof-batch-b520

Lee was one of the great Master Distillers of Buffalo Trace for 36 years, before retiring in 1985 and passing in 2013. As the pioneer of mass produced single barrel bourbons, Elmer was responsible for bringing Blanton’s to market and was eventually honored by Buffalo Trace himself with his own single barrel bourbon. This particular single barrel used Buffalo Trace’s #2 mashbill which is a high rye (~15%).","Honey upfront with undertones of maple and vanilla. This bourbon has a nose that doesn’t overpower you.  Instead, it offers a package of light, sweet smells that make you think that someone served you dessert in the form of a glass full of bourbon.","Upon tasting this bourbon, I was treated to hints of peach, dried raisin, and maple candy. This was quickly followed by a burst of wood and spice akin to pre ground black pepper, which is expected out of a 12 year bourbon and one that uses Buffalo Trace’s #2 mashbill.","The finish on this was long and very dry. The spice disappeared and was replaced with leather, aged wood, and tobacco leaves that lingered in my mouth. Sitting and thinking about this finish brought visions of Elmer sitting in a rocking chair and enjoying a glass of his own bourbon while overlooking the bluegrass of the Kentucky countryside. A really delightful finish that’s indeed simple and easy to enjoy.","While lower in proof than most single barrels, this bourbon still provides a lot of good flavor, especially considering it’s been sitting in wood for 12 years. As far as single barrel’s go, this is a nice bourbon. It won’t knock your socks off in its nose, palate or finish. But, overall it still delivers a very well balanced product.","This bourbon is often overlooked. But, for less than $35 Elmer’s is a steal. Are there better single barrels out there? Sure, even ones that share the same #2 mashbill from Buffalo Trace (ala Blanton’s). However, for the price, you can’t beat Elmer’s. In fact, for a little more than a bottle of Blanton’s you can have two bottles of this single barrel…which you may need, as this Bourbon is a delight to share with friends on a relaxing Friday night.",A bourbon worthy of the Elmer T. Lee namesake.,"Elmer T. Lee Single Barrel continues to honor the tradition of one of Buffalo Trace’s great master distillers. You get a delicious 12 year old single barrel that was pulled from the aging warehouses just in time, delivering a lot of nice subtle flavors without being overwhelmed with a woody taste. A lot of people often pass on this bourbon, and that’s a shame since it’s truly delightful, especially for the price. If you haven’t dived into the world of single barrel bourbons, this single barrel is a great place to start.",Jordan,3,4,3.5,3,4.5,4,https://www.breakingbourbon.com/review/elmer-t-lee-single-barrel
,Four Roses 2016 Limited Edition Small Batch,Classification: Straight Bourbon,Company: Kirin Brewery Company,Distillery: Four Roses,Released: September 2016,Proof: 111.2,Age: Blend of Three Bourbons with a Minimum 12 Years (two 12 year-olds and one 16 year-old),"Mashbill: Blend of Three Bourbons with Two Mashbills (OESO and OESK - 75% corn, 20% rye, 5% malted barley and OBSV - 60% corn, 35% rye, 5% malted barley)",Color: Medium Amber,MSRP: $129 (2016),Official Website,"While Master Distiller Brent Elliott has worked with Master Distiller Jim Rutledge (now retired) in selecting Limited Edition Small Batch blends for years, this is the first Limited Edition Small Batch released completely under Elliott’s guidance. It follows Elliott’s first solo Limited Edition release, “Elliott’s Select,” a single barrel, barrel proof bourbon released in June of 2016.

According to Elliott, the OESO bourbon within the blend was selected as the anchor for this year’s Limited Edition Small Batch. The recipe’s fruitiness was then balanced with more age and spice from the additional OBSV and OESK recipes selected for the batch. It is the first time in over seven years that the OESO recipe has appeared in a Limited Edition Small Batch. (The standard Four Roses Small Batch is a blend of four different recipes - OBSK, OESK, OBSO, and OESO and bottled at 90 proof.)

This year’s Limited Edition Small Batch is bottled at barrel strength with 9,258 hand-numbered bottles to be released in the United States beginning in mid-September.","Hints of aged oak mingle with summer fruits, honey, and caramel. It’s quite easy on the nose considering the proof. While pleasant, it’s easily forgotten.","A tidal wave of flavor bursts forth, coating my mouth with a rich, velvety feel. Summer fruits provide the base of flavor, with seasoned oak, caramel, rye spice, and a bit of honey balancing things out. The delicious combination of flavors with its fruit-forward base is oddly unique, yet familiar and traditional at the same time.","The finish is really where this bourbon shines. Seasoned oak slowly overtakes the summer fruits, caramel, and honey but allows their sweetness to remain. It lasts and lasts with hints of rye spice and burnt brown sugar appearing later, adding a satisfying layer of dimension. It’s exceptional and leaves a memorable impact.","Four Roses Limited Edition Small Batch is known for its high quality and uncompromising balance. Being the first solo Limited Edition Small Batch release from Master Distiller Brent Elliott, the ultimate question is “how does this compare to years past?” Elliott has worked alongside Jim Rutledge in selecting the bourbons that made up the Limited Edition Small Batch blends for years, and in our interview with him earlier this year described struggles with Rutledge in agreeing on the blend that would ultimately become the 2014 Limited Edition Small Batch. While I’ve only had one pour of the 2014, it failed to make a lasting impression on me.

Elliott’s background is in chemistry and his former role with Four Roses was in quality control. While Four Roses has mastered consistency with their standard bourbon lineup, their Limited Edition releases deviate from simply matching already established flavor profiles as they strive to seek out something both exceptional and unique representing the best the distillery has to offer. As Elliott says in reference to Limited Edition Small Batch creation, “I’m not really satisfied until it consistently, in my opinion, is as good or better than previous releases.” Arguably, this weights individual taste preference much more heavily in the equation, presenting both the opportunity for success along with a greater risk of failure.

So how does Elliott’s taste preference differ from Rutledge’s when it comes to selecting barrels and establishing a flavor profile for Limited Edition Small Batch releases? Only time will really tell and Rutledge’s shoes are big ones to fill, but this year’s Limited Edition Small Batch is top notch. While I have not tasted or deeply evaluated every Limited Edition Small Batch released by Four Roses to date, 2016 stands out as my favorite so far demonstrating not only impeccable balance true to the brand, but also a memorable flavor profile to go along with it.","While it’s generally of similar quality to other highly sought after limited releases, anecdotally speaking Four Roses Limited Edition Small Batch has not experienced the level of “frenzy” as others in the category, including most in the Buffalo Trace Antique Collection and Pappy Van Winkle lineups. The MSRP on Limited Edition Small Batch has climbed rapidly in just a few years, from around $85 in 2013 to $129 in 2016, though actual price will vary a bit by state and some retailers will certainly mark that up. Keeping in mind that this is still going to be difficult to find near MSRP, those who put in the time might find the opportunity to purchase at retail more easily than other highly revered limited editions in the category.

Considering the quality of this vintage and what is happening in the greater bourbon marketplace right now, $129 is a fair price. This is worth your consideration if faced with a choice amongst other limited edition releases this year, especially considering the generally disappointing Buffalo Trace Antique Collection and Knob Creek 2001 Limited Edition lineups.",Four Roses 2016 Limited Edition Small Batch is a memorable bourbon worthy of both the asking price and the hunt you’ll have to engage in to find it.,"Premium and limited edition bourbons continue to be released in growing numbers, growing price tags, and increasingly mediocre quality. Four Roses is a distillery known for consistency and quality, however I have not tasted or deeply evaluated every Limited Edition Small Batch release to date. With that in mind, I may be in the minority as I have typically found the annual Limited Edition Small Batch to be of high quality but not overly exciting, despite high ratings from many reviewers. The 2016 vintage stands out as the best Limited Edition Small Batch bourbon from Four Roses that I’ve tasted, holding company with other highly regarded bourbons and providing a memorable experience. This year’s release is absolutely worth seeking out.

,Four Roses 2018 Limited Edition Small Batch 130th Anniversary Edition,Classification: Straight Bourbon,Company: Kirin Brewery Company,Distillery: Four Roses,Released: September 2018,Proof: 108.4,"Age: Blend of 10 (OBSV), 13 (OBSF), 14 (OESV), and 16 (OESK) year old bourbons","Mashbill: Blend of four bourbons with two mashbills (OBSV and OBSF - 60% corn, 35% rye, and 5% malted barley / OESV and OESK - 75% corn, 20% rye, and 5% malted barley)",Color: Copper,MSRP: $140 (2018),Official Website,"This year’s edition celebrates the company’s 130th Anniversary. According to the company’s press release, Four Roses Master Distiller Brent Elliott said, “From the beginning of the process, I focused on building around the unique fruit flavors in our F and V yeast strains, and these flavors shine through in the finished product. As a contrast, I also included a spicy, older batch. By mingling these different flavor profiles, I think we achieved a wonderfully balanced, complex and unique bourbon.” Bottled at barrel strength, Four Roses will distribute approximately 13,140 bottles for this release.","Strong and attention grabbing with aromas of cherry, green apple, honey, almond, and oak. It’s warm and rich, knocking out any alcohol notes and asking for repeated nosings. The nose is very well developed with wonderful depth and complexity. Repeat nosings bring out dried raisins, vanilla, and hints of pine. Overall it’s easy to dissect and enjoy.","A delicate yet robust delivery of summer fruits, fried dough, allspice, pine, and apricot. The flavors blend surprisingly well and don’t muddle, which make for an interesting flavor profile. The overall intensity of heat and flavors is well matched, producing a flavorful and really enjoyable pour.","The heat and robustness ramps up on the finish, crescendoing in a warming oak and spice mix. It’s less complex than the rest of the sip, but bookends the bourbon nicely. It’s classic Four Roses through and through.","Four Roses Limited Edition Small Batch has a great track record year after year of high quality blended bourbon. A lot of this has to do with each release striving for a more delicate and homogeneous flavor presentation. Simply put, they’re the opposite of in-your-face bourbons. They’re sophisticated and complex, asking for drinkers to explore the flavors and pull out their nuances. This is an increasingly rare occurrence. Expert blending might be on the upswing, but Four Roses has been a master of it for some time and proves it year after year.

This edition’s average age clocks in a few notches lower than previous years, which seems to have added some extra spunk. The palate is much more robust and lively, and the flavors a bit more unusual. The oak influence is very much present, yet it is more equally distributed. 2018 Limited Edition Small Batch still tastes like a Four Roses product, but with a much welcomed flavor twist added in. This is exactly what a limited edition blend should be from Four Roses: a nice balance of classic and new.","It's hard to argue that Four Roses isn’t one of the premier blenders currently bringing blends to the market. Yet more than once I’ve passed on a bottle of their limited releases. Is it because of the price? Like most limited releases, the price of this release has steadily risen over the years. It’s still priced respectably for what it is and compared to its competition, yet I still don’t always pull the trigger.

Release after release the company’s blends are well executed and nicely nuanced, but that is where the problem may lie. Too often limited releases are bombastic screaming for attention. Four Roses limited editions are the opposite. They’re shy and gracious, perhaps too much. There are also Four Roses’ other everyday releases that are extremely consistent and reliable products, which sometimes makes it hard to justify spending that much more for their limited editions. This year’s release seems to have found a nice middle ground. It has a bit more pop than previous limited editions, but is still built on the complexity that these releases are known for. It’s a satisfying balance that easily justifies its value.",A limited release known for its subtlety brings a welcomed robustness that livens the blend.,"Expert blending might be the next big trend in bourbon, but Four Roses has been banking their limited releases on it for many years now. As there is only so much pomp and circumstance companies can manufacture for a limited release, at some point, pure skill and craftsmanship are going to be the true star of the show. This isn’t always easy to do as everyone is looking for the next big thing. Maybe this is the reason the company’s limited releases, while praised, don’t get the rabid and vocal fanfare other limited releases do.

In a way, this year’s Limited Edition Small Batch is a direct response to that. It’s delicate and subtle when it needs to be, but more robust and attention grabbing than usual. It has a wonderful and lively nose, that’s equalled by a flavorful palate, and capped off by a warm and satisfying finish. This is yet another well crafted limited edition by Four Roses and master distiller Brent Elliott, that just might be enough for me to pull the trigger this year.

,George T. Stagg 2014 Release,Classification: Straight Bourbon,Company: Sazerac Company Inc.,Distillery: Buffalo Trace,Released: Fall 2014,Proof: 138.1,"Age: 16 Years, 4 Months",Mashbill: Undisclosed,Color:  Dark Cherry,MSRP: $80 (2014),Official Website,"This year’s George T. Stagg is the product of 161 hand-picked barrels. 74.81% was lost to evaporation. By our estimate a total of 10,849 bottles will be released which is 348 less than 2013. Although Buffalo Trace originally posted a press release stating there was more Stagg this year than last year, our calculations did not support the statement. There were 157 barrels in 2013 and 161 in 2014, a 2.5% increase. However, the evaporation loss had also increased by 5.5% from 2013 to 2014, eclipsing the gain in barrels and resulting in a lower overall bottle count by our estimate. We followed up directly with Buffalo Trace and although they could not provide exact bottle counts they did state the following: “There are many factors involved in the production of our bourbons, and not everything can be calculated based on our press release.”","Burnt wood, caramel, and a hint of vanilla. There's alcohol with some burn, but it's surprisingly mild on the nose for the proof. I had to inhale more deeply than anticipated to pull out what I did here.","Caramelized wood and burnt brown sugar take the forefront bringing some sweetness into play. Dry wood and leather oppose the sweetness, while a hint of dark chocolate brings everything together. The alcohol creeps up after a moment rather than hitting you right up front, spiking mid-palate with Stagg’s well known cinnamon spice. After the spicy kick it dries out quickly getting woody and tannic leading into the finish.","The tannic bitterness transitions back to sweet. Caramel and burnt brown sugar come into play once again. The alcohol burn lingers in the back of your throat, which hides the flavors a little bit in the finish. It warms your chest in a good way, but not as much as expected for the proof. Medium to long finish overall.","Five years ago barrel proof bourbons were less common than today. Because this has become a more popular trend, George T. Stagg has quite a bit more competition when it comes to robust, “straight-from-the-barrel” proof monsters. Despite this, Stagg still maintains a unique flavor profile amongst the competition. Maybe a better question is “How unique is this year’s Stagg compared with prior years?”

To answer that question, I poured some 2012, 2013, and 2014 for a Stagg vs. Stagg vs. Stagg showdown. The result surprised me. 2012 is almost perfection. It’s textbook Stagg flavor profile with all the barrel-char robustness you might envision. 2013 stands apart from the others with a more unique profile which I actually picked blind out of the three. Finally our bourbon in review, 2014... unfortunately it takes a backseat to the previous releases in robustness of flavor. It’s still a top notch bourbon, just not quite as ""wow"" as the past two years when sipped side by side. 2012 dominates as my favorite of the three - a robust and traditional Stagg that is everything you could ever want it to be. 2013 wins out for uniqueness and fullness of flavor, although I prefer the 2012’s profile by comparison. This is just a matter of preference because 2013 is also outstanding - there's quite a nose on it too. 2014 presents a drier, woodier, and less full flavor profile than both of the past two releases making it my least favorite when sipped side by side. It’s essentially a tamer, oakier version of the 2012 release, which might appeal to some. Keep in mind this was a full-on technical tasting. Sipped on their own it’s more difficult to pick out these nuances and some may prefer 2014’s flavor profile over the past two years.","Like the rest of the Buffalo Trace Antique Collection you can’t go wrong with Stagg. It’s a must buy at $80 and even worth paying a little more if you need to. A $10 increase in MSRP over last year seems fair. We estimate around 10,849 bottles will be released this year, which is miniscule considering those bottles need to be shared among everyone worldwide. Check out our 2014 BTAC Fact Sheet for full details on this and the rest of the BTAC collection.","Maybe not the biggest “Staggy” beast, but still a beast of a bourbon worthy of its name.","George T. Stagg is a beast of a bourbon. It consistently makes many enthusiasts’ list of favorites for the year, mine included. Despite the growing competition in the barrel proof arena, when you’re thirsty for Stagg it seems there is no other bourbon that can quench that thirst. I’m not always in the mood for it, but when I am, I really am. This year’s Stagg is no exception. Although I did a fairly technical comparison with 2012 and 2013 versions and found 2014 to have the least powerful flavor profile, it is still a top notch bourbon and Stagg fans will not be disappointed.",Nick,3,4,3.5,3.5,4,4,https://www.breakingbourbon.com/review/george-t-stagg-2014-release

Spice without burn: amazing.","Longer lingering with plenty of spice, but still very little burn.

Although I really enjoy it, it’s so unique that I can’t predict whether or not everyone will find it as appealing as I do. Some may even downright hate it even if they can appreciate its uniqueness simply because the flavors are not to their liking.

Although High West does not disclose the breakdown of its ingredients, you can be satisfied knowing you’re getting at least some of the refinement brought to you by its 16 year old ingredient. I would take this over a $70 bottle of WhistlePig any day of the week. This is a must buy and could sell for double the price if High West wanted.",A masterpiece of not-so-typical flavors blended into an easy-to-drink low-priced bottle of awesomeness. What more could you ask for?,"Ryes are becoming more popular during this whiskey craze. Unfortunately, producers can’t just crank out good juice at a moment’s notice, so we still don’t see an overwhelming number of rye choices on the liquor store shelves. Sourcing from existing stock elsewhere, David Perkins was able to create something really magical with this one as unique and interesting flavors come together for a ridiculously good price.

Burnt brown sugar also enters, further sweetening the sip. A good dose of rye spice is balanced by the other elements, including a little bit of burnt wood. Full-flavored and complex.","Wood becomes more evident, a testament to the 16 year old rye within the mix. After a seemingly sudden finish, a delicate amount of burnt sugar and wood still linger for a while. At first I thought this was an abrupt finish, but it turns out its just so full flavored on the palate that I wasn’t noticing the flavors still present long after the sip.","The large amount of rye in the mashbills combined with a 16 year old ingredient are likely what give this its wonderful balance of spicy and sweet. Although the basic flavor elements could be described as traditional, it’s the balance that makes the Rendezvous stand out. Because this is a blend of two whiskeys that were sourced by High West, this will likely sell out eventually, at which point there won’t be anything quite like it out there.","Upon first sip it is evident that you’re drinking a top notch whiskey that could stand up against those with both greater age and a higher sticker price. Ryes are tricky too, because they have a sweet spot in the 6-8 year old range. With the Rendezvous, we seem to get the best of both worlds with a balance of youthful and refined elements coming together in a truly premium whiskey.","Full flavored and complex, but still a blend of traditional flavors that should appeal to the masses.","Rendezvous Rye delivers a full flavored and complex sip with elements from both its 6 and 16 year ryes mingling well together, giving it something different than other ryes out there. Despite its high rye content, this one pulls in a good dose of sweetness, likely due to its 16 years in the barrel ingredient. The Rendezvous is solid in all categories and makes you wonder if you should stock up before they inevitably run out of supply.

If it was wine or rum I think it would be more evident. The most notable thing about this whiskey is how smooth it is. Combine this with its complexity and good flavor do make it unique in a sense. As a comparison, Barterhouse is incredibly smooth, but it almost tastes like they added too much water to proof it down. The Rocky Mountain Rye could easily go unnoticed as special by anyone not paying attention to the subtleties it offers. However, there is something good going on here.","It’s 21 years old and there were only 75 barrels total. This certainly makes it seem special. At an original price of $130 and upwards of $200 or more if you’re lucky enough to locate a bottle today you would expect something special. It’s certainly high quality, goes down easy (maybe a little too easy), and it’s very enjoyable. I doubt you’d find any whiskey drinker that could say they don’t like this. Unfortunately it seems to be missing the X-factor. It just doesn’t have that hard-to-describe element that makes it really stand out. Because of this, I think it’s overpriced for what you’re getting. It’s delicious, no doubt, but the age and scarcity dictate the price in this case. You’re likely to find near-equal competition in the $50-$70 range.",If there was a dessert whiskey this would be it -  smooth and sweet with a hint of spice.,"Smooth. So smooth. I can’t say it enough. It’s hard to believe this is 92 proof. It’s also hard to believe it’s even a rye and aged for 21 years in a barrel. It’s light in color and low on spice. I could drink this all day every day - I’d stock my shelves with this if it was available and more reasonably priced. This is an impeccably balanced whiskey with a delicious flavor profile. I find the Sazerac 18 to be subtle - this is like an even more subtle version of that. Don’t get me wrong, this is a phenomenal whiskey. However, the 21 years are not absolutely obvious, and it has less spice than I typically want in a rye. It's very good but not quite as amazing as I had hoped.",Nick,4,4,3.5,4,2,4,https://www.breakingbourbon.com/review/high-west-rocky-mountain-rye-21-year
,Jefferson's Ocean Aged At Sea Voyage 2,Classification: Straight Bourbon,Company: Jefferson's,Distillery: Sourced,Released: March 2014,Proof: 90,Age: NAS (See notes),Mashbill: Undisclosed,Color:  Honeyish Copper,MSRP: $70 (2014),Official Website,"This is Jefferson’s second ocean-aged bourbon release consisting of a total of 66 barrels, significantly larger than the first release which yielded only 250 bottles. For this release, 62 barrels produced approximately 13,500 bottles which are available for purchase nationwide in 2014. The bourbon's age is estimated as 7-8 years on land and an additional 5-10 months at sea The bottles from the remaining 4 barrels will be auctioned with proceeds going to benefit OCEARCH. OCEARCH is a non-profit company that researches great white shark and other large apex predators. Chris Fisher, Founding Chairman and Expedition Leader, is a friend of Trey Zoeller, Jefferson’s founder and master distiller. The 4 barrels that will be auctioned off were placed on OCEARCH’s 126-foot vessel. The 62 barrels made available to the public were placed on a container ship and were reported to have stopped in 5 different continents and crossed over the equator 4 times. It is believed by some that bourbon aging was discovered accidentally in the late eighteenth century when barrels were shipped down the Ohio and Mississippi rivers to New Orleans, which may have contributed to Trey’s idea to try this.

Be sure to check out: Ocean 3 Review, Ocean 4 Review and Q&A with Trey Zoeller.","Nice with elements of vanilla, caramel, and burnt wood.","Savory with a wonderfully thick and coating mouthfeel. Sweet elements of butterscotch, caramel, vanilla, and burnt brown sugar balance nicely with an opposing bitterness. There is some heat and delicious elements of fresh wood, not overpowering though. I’ll clear this up in case you’re wondering - it’s not salty. As I understand it, salt is used by chefs in just about every dish, including desserts, because it enhances the flavor of just about anything. I would agree there is a possibility of some saltiness in here as a flavor enhancer, I just don’t taste it as a separate element.","Medium length with sweetness from the palate at first followed by a fairly strong bitterness. This was my least favorite part of the sip, but not horrible.","The ocean-aging alone makes this unique, but it doesn’t stop there. The end result is a fairly complex bourbon with a wonderfully rich mouthfeel. There are more good wood flavors here than any other bourbon I can think of under 15 years of age. It seems that the movement of the liquid within the barrels really allowed for a better extraction of wood-driven flavor elements than a typical aging process. Whether or not ocean air made it’s way into the barrels and had any impact is unclear to me. As I understand it, the liquid seeps through the wood of the barrel and evaporates, rather than outside air making its way into the barrel on a regular basis. In other words, I’m not really sure barrels breathe air in and out to a significant extent. Assuming some ocean air did make its way in, I’m not certain air with some higher salt content within the barrel would have much of an impact on the flavor of the juice. Either way, it does seem reasonable after tasting it that the combination of movement, temperature fluctuation, and a different environment created on a boat actually contributed to the end result in a noticeable and positive way.","Call this a gimmick if you like, but I’m all for the idea of trying something different like this. Someone has to be the first to do it and I’m proud to support that, even if it means paying a little more for a 7-8 year old bourbon than the norm. I expect there will be price gouging on this one - so far even the liquor stores are increasing their price right out of the gate. This is not a $100 bottle, but it may be worth that for anyone as interested in the concept as I am. With only 13,500 bottles for purchase, I have a feeling bourbon enthusiasts all over will be scrambling to experience this for themselves and that will naturally drive the price up. For that reason, anything under $100 is probably within the realm of reason, simply considering supply and demand. Anything over $100 is probably a bit much. I would suggest trying a pour at a bar before shelling out the bucks for this unless you don’t mind paying a little extra to try something different.","A successful end product as the result of an interesting experiment - I’m glad to have a bottle. Not budget friendly though, so bourbon enthusiasts should decide whether to seek out a pour or a whole bottle depending on how much they’re willing to shell out to try something different. This is one you need to experience for yourself as opinions on it will vary significantly.","I had mixed feelings about this one going into it. I was intrigued by the first release and had I thought I could ever get my hands on a bottle I probably would have shelled out a few hundred just to try it and obtain the bragging rights. Reviews are mixed for this second release with the word “gimmick” being used as a common descriptor. Is this really just an overpriced marketing stunt or is there something more going on here? Despite all the negative controversy I was still very excited to get my hands on a bottle and see for myself. The possibility of something amazing as a result of the ocean-aging really had me wondering. So here I am glass in hand, torn between excitement and the idea that the most probable outcome would be disappointment. Surprise was my initial reaction. This bourbon is actually pretty good. It’s got enough age to have developed some interesting flavors and it seems truly possible that the ocean aging did actually have an impact on the end product. It is more complex than most comparably aged bourbons and beautifully viscous - the rich, coating mouthfeel is excellent. I’ve had 3 pours on separate sittings as of writing this review, and it continues to intrigue me. Shout out to company founder and master distiller Trey Zoeller - keep doing these experiments man!",Nick,3,5,2.5,5,3,4,https://www.breakingbourbon.com/review/jeffersons-ocean-aged-at-sea-voyage-2
,Knob Creek 25th Anniversary Bourbon,Classification: Straight Bourbon,Company: Beam Suntory,Distillery: Jim Beam,Released: June 2017,Proof: 122.1,Age: NAS (Age ranges from 12-13 years based on company press release and determined by barreled date on label),"Mashbill: 77% Corn, 13% Rye, 10% Malted Barley",Color:  Deep Amber,MSRP: $130 (2017),Official Website,"According to the company press release, “In 1992, Sixth Generation Beam Master Distiller Booker Noe created Knob Creek Bourbon to restore the standards of pre-prohibition style whiskey, pushing the boundaries of an entire category with the introduction of super-premium, small batch bourbon. Twenty-five years later, Booker’s son and Seventh Generation Master Distiller Fred Noe is celebrating this milestone with the launch of an exclusive, limited-edition release ­– Knob Creek 25th Anniversary Bourbon. Uniting the signature whiskey making styles of Booker and Fred Noe for the first time, Knob Creek 25th Anniversary Bourbon is a cask strength and unfiltered single barrel bourbon, aged in barrels for twelve-to-thirteen years and personally selected by Noe for this historic occasion.” The company goes on to describe it as “the truest expression of Knob Creek’s iconic flavor.”

25th Anniversary is being released nationwide in limited quantities. Being a single barrel bourbon, the flavor profile will vary among bottles, with proofs ranging from 120-125. This is the first time Knob Creek has released a bourbon at cask strength. Incidentally, the standard Knob Creek Single Barrel is released at 120 proof, however the smaller volume samples offered via the barrel selection program are bottled at barrel proof, which is often around 130 proof (based on experience).","Cinnamon sticks, seasoned oak, and tobacco are countered by the scent of sweet caramel. It’s in your face and potent, but not overly hot. Very nice overall.","A dollop of spice lands on entry, and it feels satisfyingly heavy on the tongue. A burn is present but not overpowering, allowing you to roll the bourbon around in your mouth long enough to experience the flavors. It’s bold and delicious, with charred oak, allspice, and tobacco against a blanket of sweet vanilla.","The finish kicks off with a blast of cinnamon spice, which mellows slowly allowing burnt tobacco, seasoned oak, caramel, and a touch of leather to crescendo. It turns dry, with oak and cinnamon spice dominating the finish. The finish is exceptional, lingering long after the sip and leaving you craving more.","25th Anniversary doesn’t break barriers with any of its credentials on paper, and that’s a good thing as far as I’m concerned. Beam didn’t push the envelope on age, excessively high proof, or anything else outside the box with this release. There’s no crazy story here either - even the company press release describes it as “the truest expression of Knob Creek’s iconic flavor,” which is basically saying it’s within the range of their standard flavor profile. Presumably there was more care in selecting the barrels, and pushing the age just a few years beyond the norm is proof positive of what a few more years in the barrel can do for a high proof Knob Creek Single Barrel. No doubt there are special one-off Knob Creek single barrels out there that may top this, but chances of finding one are going to be slim.","When it comes to value, limited release bourbons should always give you pause. Is it really a better whiskey? Is it more valuable because it’s limited? Is the main factor driving your interest simply a fear of missing out?

Last year the Knob Creek 2001 Limited Edition bourbons were released in five batches - Eric reviewed the first three of them. While I generally agree with his overall conclusion, which is that the batches were good but not spectacular, the fact remains that I still preferred the standard Knob Creek Single Barrel over 2001. It’s generally found in the low $40 range and readily accessible, so what would draw me to a lesser bourbon that comes with a higher price? The challenge for a brand with a great always available and affordable product is a tough one - how do you offer a limited release that tops it?

Fortunately, 25th Anniversary is exactly what a limited edition Knob Creek should be. It builds off their already fantastic Single Barrel bourbon by keeping a similar flavor profile and adding dimension while rounding out the edges and maintaining potency. Knob Creek is good at 100 proof, but it’s great at 120 proof in its standard Single Barrel form. Giving us just a little more by releasing this at barrel proof was a smart move. Pushing the envelope on age without going too far keeps 25th Anniversary’s flavor profile in line with the bold flavor Knob is known for, as opposed to entering potentially over-oaked territory and leaning heavily on higher age as a crutch to justify value. While the price of 25th Anniversary is multiples of the standard Single Barrel, it would be unrealistic to expect the experience to be multiples better as well. Instead, we get nuanced dimension and depth, pioneering into that small space of “better” that exists above an already exceptional brand. You’ll have to decide for yourself if it’s worth that much more for a bourbon that’s only slightly better, but those with the extra money to spend will be rewarded with a satisfying limited release.","Knob Creek 25th Anniversary is exactly what a limited release from the company should be - it builds off the traditional Knob Creek flavor profile but offers just enough additional proof, age, dimension, and finesse to make for an exemplary special release for the brand.","Last year’s Knob Creek 2001 Limited Edition was a bit of a head scratcher. It was released at a lower than ideal proof for the brand, didn’t offer a memorable experience, and it seemed like there was an unlimited supply as fourth and fifth batches were quietly introduced. Unlike 2001, 25th Anniversary is a fantastic bourbon. It’s pretty much exactly what the company describes it as - a true expression of the brand’s iconic flavor. If you’re a fan of Knob Creek Single Barrel and have the extra money to spare, 25th Anniversary is likely to please. It’s refreshing and maybe a bit unusual to say this given today’s market, but Knob Creek 25th Anniversary is exactly what you want, and expect, it to be.",Nick,3.5,4,4.5,3,2.5,4,https://www.breakingbourbon.com/review/knob-creek-25th-anniversary-bourbon
In Depth Review,Knob Creek Single Barrel Bourbon,Classification: Straight Bourbon,Company: Beam Suntory,Distillery: Jim Beam,Released: Ongoing,Proof: 120,Age: 9 Years,"Mashbill: 77% Corn, 13% Rye, 10% Malted Barley",Color:  Deep Amber,MSRP: $42 (2017),Official Website,,"Very sweet. Brown sugar and caramel hit first, with apple and toffee that follow. It packs a good amount of spice that makes your nose tingle, much more than any bourbon I’ve ever had. On the back end, a scent of leather is present.","At first, you think the sip is going to be harsh because of the nose, but it surprises you with a very rich and creamy sweetness. You’ll definitely notice the 120 proof, but you’ll focus more on the great flavor. The palate consists of the vanilla, maple syrup and brown sugar that the nose foreshadowed.","Hot and long lasting. Full of cinnamon, oak and leather. The sweetness from the nose and palate carries through to the end. It can be challenging at first, but very satisfying by the end.","This one is really easy to love. If you’re having a tasting and you’re not sure which bourbon to buy, this is a pretty safe bet. It might be a high proof for many people, but the flavor is hard to dislike. Even throwing a cube in it doesn’t dilute the flavor very much.  I have yet to have this with someone who disliked it. That in itself makes it pretty unique. On paper, this is simply a single barrel, higher proof version of the normal Knob Creek, yet it's far superior to it in every way. The higher proof allows the rich Knob Creek flavors to really shine.","Although it doesn’t say “barrel proof” on the bottle, few would decry if you called it that. Most barrel proof bourbons are priced over $50. This a 120 proof single barrel that ranges in price between $38 - $45 making it a fantastic deal. This can easily be your go-to mid range bourbon based on the price and availability.","So sweet and delicious, there's a lot to love with Knob Creek Single Barrel.","This is one of the easiest drinking high proofers. The sweet, flavorful palate is very addicting making it very easy to put down a few of these. I tasted this with a few friends of different degrees of bourbon tasting experience and everyone couldn’t get enough. Even the newbie, not used to high proof bourbon, loved it. It’s a very accessible bourbon that has a pleasant taste and is just layered enough to hold your interest. You’ll find a lot to love with this one and why it made our “Best $40-$50 bourbons” list.",Eric,4,4,3.5,4,4,4,https://www.breakingbourbon.com/review/knob-creek-single-barrel-bourbon
,Knob Creek Small Batch 12 Year Bourbon,Classification: Straight Bourbon,Company: Beam Suntory,Distillery: Jim Beam,Release Date: Ongoing,Proof: 100,Age: 12 Years,"Mashbill: 77% Corn, 13% Rye, 10% Malted Barley",Color: Bronze,MSRP: $60,Official Website,"Knob Creek Small Batch Bourbon is one of four bourbons that comprise Jim Beam’s Small Batch Bourbon Collection. The others are Basil Hayden’s, Baker’s Bourbon, and Booker’s Bourbon. Knob Creek 12 Year was originally positioned as a limited edition bourbon when it was released in late 2019. Since its initial release, Knob Creek 12 Year now joins Knob Creek 9 Year, as part of the standard Knob Creek small batch lineup.","An expressive nose starts things off. Toasted oak, vanilla, caramel, and fresh baked Bundt cake are present. These scents come across as rich and creamy with a very pleasing delivery. In addition to the flavors, a slight amount of ethanol is also present. While it’s not enough to put a damper on the nose, it is enough to hold it back from being truly fantastic. Even with the ethanol, the rich scents play great together and make for a really excellent way to start things off.","The extra time in the barrel is positively noticed right away. Rich oak combined with a hint of leather pops right away. Searching deeper are sweeter touches of vanilla and marshmallow along with a sprinkling of white pepper. It’s a refined and complex palate that tames the ethanol found in the nose, yet uses every bit of its 100 proof to pull forward the flavors that are present. The palate exemplifies what Small Batch Knob Creek is capable of delivering by spending more time in the barrel.","The finish ends the sip by pulling forth drier and spicier flavors of black pepper, tobacco leaf, leather, and oak. These drier flavors transition to a lingering peppery oak that’s dotted with a touch of vanilla and peanuts. The flavor combination may seem like a weird one, but it works very well in this case. While the finish doesn’t quite deliver to the same level that the palate does, the pleasingly long combination of oak and spice helps to end on a high note.","Knob Creek 12 Year is a throwback to double digit age statements, which used to be more common just a few short years ago. While the most common 10+ year small batch bourbon used to be Elijah Craig 12 Year, which was sold for around $30, that bottle now seems like a distant memory and not just one that was common to find on the shelf five years ago. Fast forward to today, and age stated small batch bourbons are rare to see. There are of course Eagle Rare and Russel’s Reserve 10 Year coming in right at 10 years (and 10 proof points lower), however non-limited edition small batch bourbons aged over 10 years old are an even bigger rarity.

From its initial release in 1992 up to late 2016, Knob Creek carried a 9 year age statement. In 2016, Beam removed the age statement saying that they could not guarantee all barrels would be aged to 9 years due to inventory issues. Beam then reverted, announcing that the age statement would return in 2020. In spring 2020, NAS Small Batch bottles were phased out with newer 9 year age stated versions.

Comparing the outgoing NAS Small Batch to Knob Creek 12 Year, it’s immediately evident that the 12 year brings back some of the shine that Knob Creek NAS lost. The result of the extra time in oak is prominent as the additional age shows through in a more complex and deeper sip that highlights rich oaky flavors throughout. Where the NAS Small Batch left you wanting just a bit more oomph throughout the sip, the 12 Year hits in all the right areas and is a great example that you don’t need to be a high octane barrel proof bourbon to deliver a fantastic sip.","In current times, any bourbon with a double digit age statement comes with a price premium. While Knob Creek 12 Year’s price of $60 may seem high, in comparison to others on the market, especially for the flavor profile delivered, it seems like a downright bargain. Now you may say to yourself that you can find 14 year old Knob Creek Single Barrels for the same price or less that are higher in proof and also taste great. What needs to be remembered here is that not all single barrels are the same and not everyone wants such a high proof. Sure some of these single barrels can be standouts, but others can be duds. What Knob Creek 12 Year delivers for the price is consistency. And in this case, a consistent flavor profile that is the best non-limited edition Knob Creek Small Batch to date. That is a rarity and what more distilleries should strive to emulate nowadays in regards to delivering a great age stated bourbon for a price that won’t break the bank.","Knob Creek 12 Year is a reminder that a bourbon doesn’t need to be a high octane barrel proof pick, a limited edition special release, or even a single barrel to offer a fantastic sip that is available year round.","Adding age to their Small Batch Collection is a route that Beam has been taking in the last few years. Sometimes it comes in a permanent fixture like Baker’s 7 year age or Booker’s varying age statement and the return of Knob Creek Small Batch’s 9 year age statement, and other times it comes in limited edition forms like Baker’s 13 Year Single Barrel or Basil Hayden's 10 Year. Sometimes this extra age, along with the associated extra price, works in the bourbon's favor, and other times it makes you scratch your head.

In this case, Knob Creek 12 Year is a testament to the fact that sometimes it’s worth paying a premium for an age stated bourbon. Compared to standard release Knob Creek Small Batch bourbons of the past, 12 Year delivers the richest flavor profile to date. That flavor comes at a premium price however, and I would expect its higher price may make many pause. In this case however, the price justifies the sip and is worth the time to seek out a bottle.",Jordan,4,4,3.5,3,3,4,https://www.breakingbourbon.com/review/knob-creek-small-batch-12-year-bourbon

This year’s edition, Chapter 03, has been titled “The Road Home.” Chapter 03 is a unique blend of bourbons: 9 year old Knob Creek, 9 year old Basil Hayden's, 11 year old Booker's, and 12 year old Baker's. The blend is bottled uncut at 122.6 proof and is available nationwide. You can read more about it in the company’s press release.","Elegant classic bourbon scents waft out of the glass. Aged leather and oak mingle with toasted brown sugar, crème brûlée, and a faint floral undertone. Ethanol mingles in and out, reminding you of the higher proof velocity of the sip to come. It’s a nice way to kick things off and helps set the tone for the sip.","Fans of all of the various lines of Jim Beam’s Small Batch Collection will be extremely pleased with what this palate delivers. Rye spice is immediately noticeable and comes rushing in. Hiding behind the rye spice are caramel, honey, black pepper, vanilla, and aged oak. The proof clearly plays a role in amplifying all of the flavors present. This is a big bold palate that pulls forth all of the best features of the various members of Beam’s Small Batch Collection.","A hot and peppery finish. Big bold rye spice and black pepper are at the forefront with a hint of sweetness mixed in. It then transitions to just leather, oak, vanilla, and rye spice. Long lasting, these flavors continue to deliver, hanging on for an incredibly lengthy amount of time. The finish highlights the ages without coming across as overly oaky or over-aged.","The Little Book Series has always been about creating a more unique experience. Its past chapters have included various blends that you normally wouldn’t think would work well together, but do. In the case of Little Book Chapter 3, Freddie has literally done something that many bourbon drinkers probably always wanted to do, combine Beam’s Small Batch Collection into a Frankenstein blend. In this case though, Freddie took it to the next level.

You assume that Little Book Chapter 3 not only is using hand-selected barrels of what are presumably some of the best “honey” barrels of each of the Small Batch Collection’s brands, but also ones consumers can’t buy. With the exception of Knob Creek which has been released as a 9 year 120 proof single barrel and as a 100 proof Small Batch that recently regained its 9 year age statement, each of the expressions was pulled from aged barrels that aren’t offered to consumers. Additionally and perhaps most interestingly, since the blend is being bottled uncut, it includes bourbons from the Small Batch Collection normally not offered in cask strength form.

While each chapter of the series is meant to be unique, this one nails everything you’d want out of a unique bourbon. At its core, it is a high proof, bold bourbon with an enjoyable flavor profile that somehow manages to highlight the best traits of each of the Small Batch Collection brands - not a small feat mind you. More importantly however, is that it’s one that helps elevate the sum of its parts. You can call it a frankenstein bourbon or an expertly blended product, but at the end of the day, this is one of the most unique offerings utilizing current variations of products in production by a major distillery in recent times.","Little Book Chapter 3 saw a $25 dollar increase over the $100 asking price from last year’s batch. Some may scoff at the price and say that they could just go out and buy all four bottles of the Small Batch Collection for under $200 and have four bottles of bourbon on their hands versus just one. Carrying forward that logic, one might even assume they could just experiment with a blended ratio at home to recreate Little Book Chapter 3.

Except Little Book Chapter 3 contains unique Small Batch Collection barrels that aren't available elsewhere. Sure you could buy all four bottles in the Small Batch Collection and make your own blend, however you won’t be able to recreate what’s in Little Book Chapter 3. With that in mind, the asking price of $125 seems very appropriate here, and one of the better values out their for 2019 limited releases.",A unique blend with a big bold flavor profile that should draw more attention to the  Little Book series moving forward.,"Little Book Chapter 3 suprised me. Individually I enjoy each of the Small Batch Collection brands, however I couldn’t imagine pouring them all together and still achieving a well-balanced end result. In this case however, that’s exactly what ended up in the bottle. The sip helps to highlight the best traits of each of the individual brands that end up in the blend. It’s one that bourbon lovers of big bold high proof pours will appreciate and make them ask the question: why aren’t more distilleries creating blends of this type? If you’re a fan of Jim Beam’s Small Batch Collection and are looking for a unique application of them, Little Book Chapter 3 will be well worth seeking out.

Faint hints of cherries, cinnamon and vanilla underneath. It’s overall on the sweet side. Adding water helped cut the alcohol and allowed the other scents to come out a little more. The nose is in-line with the standard Maker’s Mark profile, but surprisingly not as potent as I would have thought being 113 proof.","Nice full-bodied mouth feel that coats your tongue. Notes of caramel, toasted nuts and cinnamon provide a wonderfully flavored sip. Deeper hints of allspice, dark fruit and a touch of molasses round it out. The palate also follows the standard Maker’s flavor profile, but it has much more life in it.","Medium to long finish that has a great mix of sweet and spicy. They play off each other nicely as they keep the high and lows in check. The tail end of the finish concludes with earthy tones. It may be on the low end of proof for a cask strength bourbon, but it still packs a decent amount of heat. Adding a few drops of water did help cut the heat and allowed me to focus more on the great flavors.","This is the first time Maker’s Mark has ever offered its product in cask strength form. It has a similar style as Old Weller Antique (107 proof) and Old Grand Dad 114 (114 proof), although Maker’s Cask Strength does a better job keeping the spice in check. The sweetness has more of a presence and helps it from being more one sided like the aforementioned bourbons.

It is also one of the few barrel proof wheaters on the market. It may not be as potent as the 130-plus proof William Larue Weller, but it captures some of that rare bourbon’s best traits. High proof wheaters have a great interplay between sweet and spicy flavors that you don’t always find in corn or rye heavy barrel proof bourbons. Simply put, they’re delicious to sip.","Maker’s was wise to soft-release this new version of their flagship bourbon in 375 ml bottles at their gift shop and slowly expand nationwide. With few barrel proof wheaters on the market, and company claims over the last few years of shortages, this allowed more bottles to get to more consumers. With 750 ml bottles now available nationwide for a respectable $55 price, consumers can now get their hands on a great product they have been clamoring for. Despite the proof being on the low side for a barrel proof bourbon, its competitive price and great flavors allow it to keep company among some of the best barrel proof bourbons on the market.",A good balance of sweet and spice with a full-bodied mouth feel that coats your tongue in complex flavors.,"Credit must be given to Maker’s Mark that they finally listened to their customers’ plea for a higher proof and therefore, more flavorful Maker’s Mark bourbon. You can find Maker’s Mark in every bar, but I can’t tell you the last time I ordered one. The bourbon is too thin and the flavor too weak and bland for me to ever show any interest in it. Maker’s Mark Cask Strength goes a long way in correcting those faults. It is now on my radar, not because it’s a new exciting bourbon, but because the flavor now raises the bourbon to a higher level.",Eric,2.5,4,4,3.5,3,4,https://www.breakingbourbon.com/review/makers-mark-cask-strength-bourbon

Each bottle in the series denoted by different color labels, with the Fall 2018 release sporting a black colored label. During the same period, Heaven Hill released a distillery-only edition with a red label and sporting a 14 year age statement. Additionally each bottle comes with a faux tax strip that discloses when the bourbon was produced and bottled.

To be labelled Bottled-in-Bond, the whiskey must be the product of one distillation season and one distiller at a single distillery, aged in a federally bonded warehouse under U.S. government supervision for at least four years, and it must be bottled at exactly 100 proof. Additionally, the Bottled-in-Bond label must clearly identify the distillery where it was distilled and where it was bottled, if different.","Soft classic scents of vanilla, hay, and light oak blend together. On the surface it doesn’t seem overly complex, but digging deeper there’s raisin, light green apple, and a smidge of cinnamon and brown sugar mixed together. The scents mingle extremely well together and present a solid start to this bourbon.","The sip provides a nice creamy viscous mouthfeel. Delicious syrupy sweet vanilla, raisins, a dab of lavender infused honey, and a touch of butterscotch. Even though it’s a 100 proof bourbon, there’s almost no burn which allows you to savor this for a while. It’s gentle yet full of flavor and simply put, fantastic.","A warming heat that showcases light oak, sweet vanilla, and a slight hint of golden raisins. The raisins are very fleeting, and leave behind a light sweet vanilla and oak taste that lingers for a short bit. This eventually transitions to just a light oak that gently lingers for a while. It’s a really nice way to cap the sip, however after the fantastic palate, I can’t help but want more out of the finish.","Bottled-in-Bond bourbons are actually more common than you think. Buffalo Trace has their E.H. Taylor line, Brown-Forman has Old Forester 1897, and Heaven Hill has a slew of Bottled-in-Bond bourbons and whiskeys. However just because a whiskey is labeled Bottled-in-Bond doesn’t guarantee that it will be good. All you know for sure is that the whiskey is at least 4 years old, bottled at 100 proof, and is the product of one distillation season and one distiller at a single distillery.

The Fall 2018 Edition of Old Fitzgerald Bottled-in-Bond delivers a wonderful overall sip. It’s rich creamy mouthfeel and well defined flavors all eb and flow incredibly well and deliver an experience that many other Bottled-in-Bonds in the market currently don’t. It’s more impressive that it does all of this without being a high proof bomb or carrying a double digit age statement, which seems to be a rarity nowadays when compared to other highly regarded limited releases.","The first edition was an 11 year old bourbon that was priced with a suggested MSRP of $110. Seeing as the fall 2018 edition is 9 years old and is priced at $90, Heaven Hill’s pricing strategy seems to be about $10 a year for their limited edition Bottled-in-Bond releases. Even the24 year old Parker’s Heritage Bottled-in-Bond was priced at $250.

While this pricing strategy is easy for consumers to understand, it still represents a big upcharge compared to other Bottled-in-Bond bourbons in the market. Heaven Hill alone makes two well received Bottled-in-Bond bourbons that are both under $30, that being Henry McKenna 10 Year and the Heaven Hill Bottled-in-Bond.

That said, price alone doesn’t solely determine value. In this case, the bourbon is fantastic and delivers an experience that makes you feel justified with the money you spent on this release. As a bonus, the bourbon comes in a bottle that can serve as a great home bar decanter once it’s emptied out. With a sub $100 price tag and a flavor profile that can back up the high cost, Heaven Hill priced this one right on the money.","If Bottled-in-Bond bourbons are supposed to show off a distiller’s talents, this is as fine of an example as there is.","Plain and simple, Old Fitzgerald Bottled-In-Bond Fall 2018 Edition really is a well balanced and all around great bourbon. In a crowded field of limited releases, the Fall 2018 edition esques any sort of gimmick and instead exemplifies everything a Bottled-in-Bond label represents. The sip is rich and refined, and has you going back for more and more. While the price may be high for some, the bourbon justifies the cost and gets me really excited to see how the rest of the Old Fitzgerald Bottled-in-Bond limited release series turns out.

,Old Forester 1920 Prohibition Style Bourbon,Classification: Straight Bourbon,Company: Brown-Forman,Distillery: Brown-Forman Shively Distillery,Released: Ongoing,Proof: 115,Age: NAS,"Mashbill: 72% Corn, 18% Rye, 10% Malted Barley",Color:  Mahogany,MSRP: $60 (2017),Official Website,"Old Forester 1920 Prohibition Style is the third expression in the Old Forester Whiskey Row Series. According to the neck tag on the bottle, “During Prohibition, only six Kentucky distilleries were granted permits to bottle bourbon for medicinal purposes. Brown-Forman, maker of Old Forester, secured Permit KY - 3. In 1920, the first bottles under this permit were produced.” It goes on to say “To match the usual barrel proof of the that bourbon after maturation, it is presented at 115 proof.”","The aroma is rich and powerful. Dark fruit, burnt brown sugar, chocolate, and a hint of bananas make up the components. Not surprising for the proof, it tingles the nostrils with a trace of ethanol. It’s a nice aroma overall, and can be easily described as a unique relative to other bourbons.","It’s big, bold, and immediately likeable. The richness of barrel char and dark chocolate play against the sweetness of caramel and creme brulee. There’s a nuttiness to it as well, along with some smokiness and a hint of coffee. The taste is reminiscent of some of the better Old Forester Birthday Bourbons I’ve had, but admittedly more pronounced and, to put it bluntly, better than I remember.","Allspice and black pepper pop initially. They quickly dissipate and leave a long-lingering finish without further introduction of new flavors, but a pleasing end to those introduced on the palate. Dark chocolate, barrel char, and that nuttiness are the most prominent. It’s a nice finish, plain and simple.","One of the first things that comes to mind with this bourbon is a likeness to a stout beer, no different than what I noticed in Old Forester’s 2013 Birthday Bourbon. That’s not to say it tastes like a beer, but where porters and stouts are often rich, chocolatey, dark beers, 1920 is a rich, chocolatey, dark bourbon. This characteristic is evident immediately. Not surprisingly, I prefer darker beers and also really enjoy this bourbon. It’s one of the few bourbons I’ve ever had that I took an instant liking to on my first sip.

While it presumably shares the same mashbill as the others in the Whiskey Row Series, it’s amazing how different it tastes. Sure the proof is higher, but inside we find an entirely different flavor profile. Brown-Forman provides little to go by as far as what might have contributed to this, other than barrel selection and masterful blending. Even by comparison with the Old Forester Birthday Bourbon Series, which can be enjoyable and echo similar flavor characteristics most likely due to the particular rickhouse and floor the barrels are pulled from, 1920 seems to stand out by offering better balance and an immediately enjoyable experience. I didn’t have to peel back layers to enjoy it.","The Whiskey Row Series is a premium line extension, and priced as such. Following suit with brands like Buffalo Trace’s E.H. Taylor lineup, it’s not surprising to see this type of premium line extension becoming more prominent. On one hand, we can say 1920 Prohibition Style is just the standard brand, same mashbill, just presented in upscale packaging and flavor profile. However, it’s important to acknowledge that whiskey makers control what they put in the bottle. In this increasingly competitive space, better distillation practices along with more careful barrel selection, blending, proofing, and other factors can lead to better final products in the end. It’s ultimately up to the consumers to decide whether it’s just a marketing play, or truly something more.

In this case, I’m fully behind the price tag, and excited for what Brown-Forman has done here. Like the others in the Whiskey Row Series, 1920 Prohibition Style introduces a complete new experience to the lineup, and it’s a good one. It’s more than just marketing, and whatever they did to curate this bourbon I can get behind. At $60, or even a little more in some markets, it’s just as good as many bourbons going for well in excess of $100. More importantly, it’s actually accessible.","Old Forester 1920 Prohibition Style presents a unique and delicious flavor profile, making it my favorite Old Forester release to date.","1920 Prohibition Style made my Favorites of 2016 list not only because it’s good, but because it’s different. In one of my recent surveys, How do Bourbon Producers Solve the Limited Release Problem?, one of the ideas proposed was that producers simply make more of the good stuff. 1920 Prohibition Style may be an example of just that. Is 1920 just more carefully selected and blended stock, or is it contingent on a very limited supply of honey barrels? Time will tell, but based on the Whiskey Row line extension and availability it seems there will be enough to go around. Maybe producers “just making more of the good stuff” isn’t such a far-fetched idea after all.",Nick,3.5,4,4,3.5,3.5,4,https://www.breakingbourbon.com/review/old-forester-1920-prohibition-style-bourbon
,Old Forester 2011 Birthday Bourbon,Classification: Straight Bourbon,Company: Brown-Forman,Distillery: Brown-Forman Shively Distillery,Released: September 2011,Proof: 98,Age: 12 Years,"Mashbill: Undisclosed (Rumored to be 72% corn, 18% rye, and 10% malted barley)",Color:  Copper,MSRP: $50 (2011),Official Website,"September 2nd marks the birthday of George Garvin Brown, one of the founders of Brown-Forman. To honor him, Brown-Forman released an Old Forester Birthday Bourbon. This bourbon is a special annual release that started in September 2002 and varies year to year based on age, warehouse location, number of barrels used, and so on. The bourbon comes in a special old fashioned glass bottle and is an anticipated release every year in the bourbon community. The 2011 bottling of Old Forester Birthday Bourbon marks the 9th year that Brown-Forman has offered this bourbon.

According to the information on the bottle, the 2011 release is crafted from a 62 barrel batch of 99Fll. The bourbon was matured in barrels crafted from the Northern and Ozark terroir sourced white oak. These barrels were stored in warehouses H and I, on their 1st and 6th floors respectively. These locations exposed the barrels to extremes of heat and cold.","The Old Forester Birthday Bourbon series usually delivers when it comes to their nose and the 2011 edition is no exception. On first whiff, I was hit with fresh oak and light vanilla. Taking a longer inhale brought about scents of fresh picked berries, milk chocolate, and new leather. It smelled so good that I had to consciously force myself to stop enjoying the nose to take a sip!","The sugars from the wood are very present in the palate. The first taste that touched my tongue was fresh sugar cane. The flavors of apricots, raisins, mixed dried fruit, honey and new wood mingled together. On the whole, the palate was light and airy, tasting a lot younger than the 12 years this bourbon sat in wood.","The finish on this bourbon was really neat. While most bourbons present a long warm finish that slowly makes its way from your mouth down to your throat, this finish tended to stay upfront and present in my mouth. It instantly warmed my mouth and stayed there for a good 2-3 minutes. It presented notes of toasted oak, honey, and a touch of cinnamon.","Don’t be fooled into thinking that this bourbon is just a marketing stunt because of its unique shaped bottle. Each yearly release of Old Forester Birthday Bourbon is completely unique. Since the Birthday series usually uses the normal Old Forester Mashbill of 72% corn, 18% rye, and 10% malted, you get to see how aging has varied over time based on years spent in the barrel, location of the barrels, aging conditions, etc.

The 2011 edition of this bourbon was really special. It was only a 66 barrel dump, which reverses the trend of going for the larger barrel dumps that the ’09 and ’10 versions saw, and is just 4 barrels more than the 62 barrel 2008 batch. Old Forester picked some great barrels for this batch, as this bourbon tastes much younger than the 12 year age statement would lead you to believe.  Because of this, it really carries through rich fruity flavors.","I’ve always found the Old Forester Birthday series to be a great value and the 2011 version was no exception. At $50, this was a great value back in ’11 when it was purchased. While it’s near impossible to find today and the price will be much higher on the secondary market, it’s being judged on the price that was paid at retail.

For the money, it's a really great bourbon that could have easily been sold for $25-30 more and still be considered a fair value. I’m glad that I have a spare on hand, and this bottle has convinced me to stock up on the new release of the Birthday Bourbon every fall!","Like a good birthday party, this great bourbon is best enjoyed with fun loving friends.","I’ve said it before, but my only real complaint of this series is the bottle design. I realize that they’re trying to play up the fact that it's a celebration bottle and brought it to retail in an ""old fashioned"" style bottle. However, it takes up a lot of shelf space and is a pain to pour from, often spilling down the sides of the bottle.

The bottle design aside, this bourbon was really great! The longer I let the ’11 edition sit in the glass, the sweeter the palate became and the nose stayed consistently great throughout. I really do wish that more than just the 66 barrels had been bottled as this is a bourbon that more people should have been able to enjoy. If you see it in your favorite bar, make sure to go out of your way to order a glass.",Jordan,4.5,4,3.5,4,4,4,https://www.breakingbourbon.com/review/old-forester-2011-birthday-bourbon
,Old Forester 2012 Birthday Bourbon,Classification: Straight Bourbon,Company: Brown-Forman,Distillery: Brown-Forman Shively Distillery,Released: September 2012,Proof: 97,Age: 12 Years,"Mashbill: Undisclosed (Rumored to be 72% corn, 18% rye, and 10% malted barley)",Color:  Medium Amber,MSRP: $55 (2012),Official Website,"September 2nd marks the birthday of George Garvin Brown, one of the founders of Brown-Forman. To honor him, Brown-Forman released an Old Forester Birthday Bourbon. This bourbon is a special annual release that started in September 2002 and varies year to year based on age, warehouse location, number of barrels used, and so on. The bourbon comes in a special old fashioned glass bottle and is an anticipated release every year in the bourbon community. The 2012 bottling of Old Forester Birthday Bourbon marks the 11th year that Brown-Forman has offered this bourbon.

According to the information on the bottle, the 2012 release is crafted from a single day’s 82 barrel batch. That day’s mash bill had an extra 2% of malt added to the fermenter. The barrels were stored in warehouse H and I where it experienced a balanced maturation environment. There the angels’ share resulted in low barrel yields.","Very sweet and nice smelling. The vanilla, caramel and brown sugar are very, very prevalent. It has a perfect amount of oak to go with it which balances the sweetness out. A small amount of alcohol is present.","Spot on with the nose, with the addition of cinnamon and baking spices. Hints of rye spices also seem to show themselves. Very pleasant and agreeable.",There’s a little bit of dryness that creeps in with the finish. Being a 12 year old bourbon this makes sense. The dryness also brings with it some spice and heat on the backside of the finish. Great end to the whole experience.,"The flavors in the 2012 edition are nothing you can’t find in many other bourbons. Vanilla, caramel and brown sugar are found in almost every bourbon. What makes this year’s edition special is the intensity of those flavors and the fantastic balance of them. When you then mix in the right amount of oak, spice and dryness, the 2012 edition really becomes the full package. Also, the extra 2% of malt added to the standard Old Forester mashbill in this Birthday edition had a positive impact on the flavor over previous years, but again, I wouldn’t necessarily call those flavors unique.","There’s a lot of state by state price fluctuation on the Forester Birthday bourbons. They can range anywhere from $40-60. With that being said, the year-to-year uniqueness this line exhibits and the general high level of quality makes this a fantastic value for the MSRP of $55. There aren’t a lot of bourbons on the market in that price range, let alone many limited edition bottles. I always feel I get my money’s worth with the Old Forester Birthday Bourbons.","It may have the typical bourbon flavors, but they are perfectly balanced and matured.","This is a benchmark for limited edition bottles. It’s priced right, Brown-Forman releases a decent amount of bottles each year and in the case of the 2012 edition, the quality is through the roof. This is my personal favorite edition of Old Forester’s birthday line of the last few years. It may not be as interesting as other years (i.e. 2013), but it’s nose, palate and finish are extremely pleasant and agreeable.",Eric,4.5,4,4,3.5,4,4,https://www.breakingbourbon.com/review/old-forester-2012-birthday-bourbon
,Old Forester 2019 Birthday Bourbon,Classification: Straight Bourbon,Company: Brown-Forman,Distillery:  Brown-Forman Shively Distillery,Release Date: September 2019,Proof: 105,Age: 11 Years,"Mashbill: Undisclosed (Previous releases were 72% Corn, 18% Rye, and 10% Malted Barley)",Color: Copper,MSRP: $100 (2019),Official Website,"The 2019 release of Old Forester Birthday Bourbon marks the 19th release of the series. Its 105 proof is the series’ highest proof to date. Brown-Forman states that a total of 120 barrels were distilled on May 15, 2008 and aged on the second floor of Warehouse I. Master Distiller Chris Morris and Master Taster Jackie Zykan selected and proofed this year's limited edition. This year’s bottling is expected to yield roughly 13,200 bottles. For more background, check out the company’s press release.","Warm and rich with inviting baking spices that are immediately noticeable. Inhaling deeper reveals oak, banana bread, vanilla, cinnamon bark, and a touch of summer fruits. While there is a hint of ethanol - which is unusual for Birthday Bourbon - it truthfully is this noses only slight flaw holding it back from being perfect. The scents mingle well and are fantastic overall, foreshadowing the sip to come.","Spice steps out front, with white pepper and light rye spice kicking off the sip. These flavors mingle with sweeter ones including vanilla, caramel, ripe melon, and a touch of honey. The spice and sweet flavors come together and balance one another well. The spice is the prominent part of the sip, yet the sweet flavors help tamper it down and result in a really nice mixture between the two contrasting flavor areas.","Long and lingering. The sweet flavors from the sip quickly fade away as spice, white pepper, oak, and a hint of leather roar to the front. The spice brings with it a mouth-filling heat that lingers well after you swallow. Oak and leather lightly remain with the slightest touches of summer fruits and mint weaving in and out. It’s not quite on par with the nose and palate, but still a nice way to round out the sip.","In 2018 Brown-Forman introduced the highest proof Old Forester Birthday Bourbon at the time. Coming in at 101 proof, 2018’s Old Forester Birthday Bourbon was really good, but  the depth of the palate didn’t create the impact I was hoping for. However, it turns out that upping the proof just a few points, targeting a year younger, and moving down a floor in Warehouse I was the magic formula. Always a unique bottling, this year’s edition seems to really deliver a pour that stands out from the crowd and certainly shows that higher proof Birthday Bourbon can be a great offering. The mixture of sweet and spice brings forth a sip with a lot of depth and one that’s both approachable and very enjoyable.","For the first time in a number of years, the Old Forester Birthday Bourbon release has not seen a price increase, instead holding at its $100 price tag from the prior year. Maybe this was always the targeted price that Brown-Forman set when they started slowly raising the price a number of years ago. Staying at $100 firmly marks this in line with other limited releases on the market today. Unlike editions in recent years however, I feel like the value is actually present in the bottle this time around.

In recent years I’ve found Old Forester Birthday Bourbon to be a really good sip, but I couldn’t fully justify the ever increasing price hikes. For the first time since 2012 I think I’ve found an Old Forester Birthday Bourbon that truly lives up to the hype. The increased proof pulls forward a rush of various flavors throughout the sip that make it feel like you would gladly spend $100 on this series every year if the end result was like 2019’s edition. If Brown-Forman can hold its price point at $100 and continue to deliver the flavor profile found in this year’s batch, many would agree that the value is there for your money.","Fulfilling in every way, 2019 finds the Old Forester Birthday Bourbon series not only elevating its proof, but also elevating the sip it delivers.","The Old Forester Birthday Bourbon series is one of my favorite bourbon releases. It’s certainly not for the obnoxious bottle it comes in, which is a pain to pour from and takes up too much space on a bar shelf. Instead it’s for the solid performing sip that it delivers year after year. I will say the last few years have been really good, but none have lived up to the greatness of the 2011 or 2012 bottlings in my book. That changed this year with the 2019 edition.

Old Forester has elevated their flavor profile over the last few years, which includes their Signature bourbon through their entire Whiskey Row Series (1870, 1897, 1910, 1920). While the Old Forester Birthday Bourbon series has always consistently delivered a good flavor profile, this year Brown-Forman delivers a really great edition. The nose is fantastic as always, but the palate and to a lesser extent the finish, are truly special too. While the price might seem high, it’s justified by the whiskey in the bottle. All around it’s a Birthday Bourbon edition that you’ll not only want to seek out, but make sure that you open up to enjoy. It would be a shame to keep collecting dust on a shelf as the whiskey waiting inside is well worth enjoying while you can.

,Old Forester 2020 Birthday Bourbon,Classification: Straight Bourbon,Company: Brown-Forman,Distillery: Brown-Forman Shively Distillery,Release Date: September 2020,Proof: 98,Age: 10 Years,"Mashbill: Undisclosed (Previous releases were 72% Corn, 18% Rye, and 10% Malted Barley)",Color: Dark Copper,MSRP: $130 (2020),Official Website,"The 2020 release of Old Forester Birthday Bourbon marks the 20th release of the series. Brown-Forman states that a total of 95 barrels were barreled on June 5, 2010. This is the third Birthday Bourbon to be bottled at the Old Forester Distilling Co. on Louisville's Historic Whiskey Row. Master Distiller Chris Morris and Master Taster Jackie Zykan selected this year's limited edition. No bottle count information was released, however the company states that the full allotment of product represents one day's production of Old Forester. For more background, check out the company’s press release.","Rich brown sugars form a heavy base and are layered with rich oak and vanilla. Light hints of molasses and yellow cake gently intermix, however the star of the show is the classic bourbon notes. The classic opening scents, while few, are deeply rich and present a nose that’s timeless and quite frankly, fantastic.","The richness found in the nose strongly carries through to the palate. Brown sugars and aged oak interweave with vanilla and a touch of raisin. The oak has slightly tannic properties that seem a tad out of place, but not enough to ruin the overall balance. Additionally, there’s quite a bit of a rye spice kick that helps add a dash of heat as you suss out the flavors. It doesn’t quite live up to the opening that the nose delivers, however it’s still delicious in its own right.","Heavy oak and spice kick things off with a strong hint of peppercorn and rye spice bringing forth a finish that is hotter than expected for a 100 proof bourbon. A dry leather note pops up on the backend helping to ground the finish away from the sweater notes found in the nose and palate. This provides for a more earthy quality, and it’s a pleasant way to end the sip.","Brown-Forman used to be incredibly transparent about their Old Forester Birthday Bourbon releases. At one time the company used to list the warehouse and floors the barrels were aged, exact bottle count, and in 2016’s case, a bonus tidbit about the barrels even being sun kissed (ooh la la). However, those pieces of information have all but dried up. The only thing we know about this year's release is that 95 barrels were selected and that they were aged for 10 years.

It’s a shame really. What was once the bourbon that came in a unique bottle and was full of details, now just has that it comes in a unique bottle going for it. Let there be no doubt that this year's edition once again delivers a great flavor profile, but unlike past editions, its proof isn’t the highest, its barrel count isn’t notable, and the most unique thing about this release is that it’s the most expensive MSRP ever for a Birthday Bourbon bottle.

With that being said, none of this changes the fact that this year’s release is a great tasting bourbon, and worthy of the brand’s 20th Anniversary bottling. The quality clearly steps above standard bottlings, regardless of the lack of information provided. It’s this consistency in quality releases that makes Old Forester Birthday Bourbon stand out amongst its peers year after year.","While Old Forester Birthday Bourbon took a pause increasing price in 2019’s edition, it resumed its course forward and saw an increase of $30. This makes it the most expensive Old Forester Birthday Bourbon ever, and now puts it in the same pricing level as Brown-Forman’s other yearly limited release from the Woodford Reserve Master’s Collection.

There’s no denying that this is a well-rounded bourbon and can stand shoulder to shoulder with some of the best Old Forester Birthday Bourbon editions including 2011, 2012, and last year's 2019 release. However, crossing the $100 threshold brings additional scrutiny and rightfully so. Old Forester Birthday bourbon is now priced on par with other yearly limited releases from major Kentucky distilleries. The bourbon inside this year's edition helps to clearly justify the price, however Old Forester Birthday Bourbon has lost its title that it used to have of being the best value around of limited releases.","While 2020 Old Forester Birthday Bourbon comes with a higher price and less background than previous years, this 20th Anniversary release will satisfy with a fantastic nose and great flavor profile to back it up.","This year's Old Forester Birthday Bourbon first and foremost delivers where it counts, and that's the overall flavor profile. While the rest of the sip can’t compete against the fantastic nose that starts things off, it holds its own and is still very respectable.

However, all of this has slowly come at a cost. Both metaphorically and also realistically, since this is now the most expensive release of Old Forester Birthday Bourbon ever. Additionally, what was once a bourbon that was transparent and open with its background, has slowly become closed off and provides little additional info to the consumer. It’s a shame too. It’s not that this information makes for a better bourbon, it instead makes for a more educated consumer - one who can learn more about what they’re drinking. And when you pay as much as this year's release is asking, I feel consumers deserve as much too.

It will be interesting to see how the brand continues to progress from here. Many won’t care what information is released, as long as the bourbon delivered continues to deliver an excellent sip, and delivers it does. Hopefully Brown-Forman reverses course and puts a stop to sharply increasing the price year-over-year, and starts to open up more on the specifics of the barrels in the bottle. In the meantime it’s hard not to recommend this year's release to anyone who has a chance to scoop one up, as it’s a worthy torchbearer for the brand on it’s 20th anniversary.",Jordan,4.5,4,3,3,3,4,https://www.breakingbourbon.com/review/old-forester-2020-birthday-bourbon

There are currently two batches released, each at cask strength and non-chill filtered. The barrels used for this offering were from the very first run of what later would become Bernheim Original Straight Wheat Whiskey. With a minimum of 51% soft winter wheat in the mash bill, Bernheim is the only straight wheat whiskey produced by a major American distiller and has been available since 2005. Simply, this is the Bernheim Original Wheat Whiskey with six additional years of aging bottled at cask strength. For every bottle sold Heaven Hill will contribute $5 to ALS research and treatment in honor of Parker.","Upon opening this for the first time it revealed very little of anything on the nose. After the bottle sat for a week or so the whiskey seems to have come alive, with a more intense mix of scents albeit still more faint than I had expected. There’s some caramel and vanilla in there. Alcohol is present, with something coming through that I just can’t seem to put my finger on. It almost has a baking bread kind of smell, but what kind I’m not sure.","I could guzzle this stuff. One of the best “Palates” in whiskey this year. The sip is delightful and full of flavor and warmth. It’s surprisingly smooth for the proof on the palate, but still has the intensity you’d expect from a barrel proof whiskey. It’s sweet, but not the same kind of sweet as a bourbon with a high amount of corn in the mash bill. The sweetness is softened by the taste of rich, warm bread just out of the oven. There's some grain and honey in there too. It’s downright delicious.","The burn intensifies quite dramatically as I swallow, developing a spicy intensity on the tongue and moving into the back of the throat. It lingers for a bit, but the flavors dissipate rather quickly along with the burn. It’s a good burn and maybe even too much for some. Considering the deliciousness of the palate it’s surprisingly not as balanced as I’d hoped.","A wheat whiskey aged 13 years is pretty damn unique. I love the fact that the annual Parker’s Heritage releases are completely different from year to year, and this is the first non-bourbon Parker’s Heritage release so far. We’ve also got the “Wheated” Maker’s Mark Cask Strength and annual BTAC William Larue Weller to compare this to, a trifecta of delicious whiskeys even if the later two are just wheated bourbons... maybe a topic for a future Breaking Bourbon Face Off. I will say this, it shows much more intensity and character when sipped next to the Maker’s Mark Cask Strength, which is also very enjoyable. Despite the interesting technicals, I didn’t find the flavor profile quite as unique as I’d anticipated. It still echoes the same traits as a bourbon, and although the flavor profile has its own unique traits, I cannot say I would have identified it as a wheat whiskey in a blind taste test.","This is a good deal. It’s a quality whiskey right up there with the Buffalo Trace Antique Collection, albeit maybe not quite as balanced in a nose - palate - finish sense. It’s MSRP is also a little higher than BTAC, although not as high as Wild Turkey Diamond Anniversary. It’s certainly not cheap, but for $90 (you may see this in the $80 - $100 range) this is definitely one of the year’s releases you should seek out.",A palate so good I could guzzle it - this is definitely one of the year’s best releases.,"This is easily one of my favorite whiskeys of the year so far. From the first sip and each pour thereafter I’ve enjoyed it immensely. The flavor profile is unique enough to inspire discussion, but mainstream enough to appeal to nearly everyone who enjoys American Whiskey. The highlight of this year’s Parker’s is the intense flavor and warmth of the palate, while the nose and finish are good yet surprisingly underwhelming in comparison.

I don’t typically add any water to my whiskey, but I do try some in barrel proofers on occasion. I use distilled water whenever I can, especially if I’m doing a review. The water was a good addition. While I still choose to drink most barrel proof whiskeys neat, I will say the addition of water to this particular whiskey does bring it into balance. It subdues the alcohol just enough to allow a nice well-rounded flavor to push through and balances the intense burn in the throat found in the finish. If you’re interested in comparing the two batches be sure to check out Josh Chinn’s (redwhiteandbourbon.com) well-written review of the first (127.4 proof) batch.",Nick,3,5,3,4.5,4,4,https://www.breakingbourbon.com/review/parkers-heritage-collection-wheat-whiskey
,Russell's Reserve 1998 Bourbon,Classification: Straight Bourbon,Company: Campari Group,Distillery: Wild Turkey,Released: August 2015,Proof: 102.2,Age: 15 Years,"Mashbill: 75% Corn, 13% Rye, 12% Malted Barley",Color: Mahogany,MSRP: $250 (2016),Official Website,"The Russell’s Reserve 1998 release is an extremely limited run of just 2,070 bottles. This makes it one of the smallest limited releases from a major Kentucky distillery in some time. According to Wild Turkey's press release, this bourbon was initially distilled and set aside to celebrate a future milestone for Jimmy Russell, but since this bourbon reached its peak of maturity, Jimmy’s son, Eddie Russell needed to dump the barrels or risk “less desirable flavors [taking] over.” With only 23 barrels of bourbon bottled, it’s the smallest batch ever released under Jimmy and Eddie’s watch. According to Josh Peters of The Whiskey Jug, Eddie told him that while he was checking on these barrels he noticed that they were evaporating a lot faster than expected. After pulling samples and checking with his dad, they dumped the barrels into a steel holding tank towards the end of 2014, making this officially a 15 year old bourbon (due to distillation date).

The bottle reviewed is number 725.","A playful marriage of sweet, spice, and oak with just the right amount of intensity. The oak can smell heavy handed at first but is actually delicately tamed by hints of vanilla and caramel, and topped off with a cherry pop. Nutmeg spice wavers throughout and gives off a slight cinnamon potpourri scent. A swirl of the glass allows the bourbon to give off an additional layer of intensity and further solidifies that this is a well crafted nose.","The sweetness continues with dark fruits, cherry, and vanilla bean, all of which are brilliantly offset by layers of seasoned oak and fresh wood. This keeps the sweetness from running unchecked as the flavors remain playful and never go overboard in one direction. The palate’s flavors contain a richness that's hard to get enough of and instantly communicates that this is not an average bourbon, but one that has been expertly matured.","The intensity of the palate’s flavors peak at the start of the finish, filling my throat and nose with warmth, as they begin to fade gracefully during the long finish. The oak notes maintain a consistency throughout and are ultimately the last flavors to trail off. It’s a enjoyable oak-forward finish with just the right intensity of flavors and warmth to produce a top-notch conclusion.","It’s common nowadays to speak about Wild Turkey’s slipping quality of their releases, specifically their special releases, over the better part of this decade. It’s a topic that dominates most Wild Turkey discussions and how could it not? It’s an odd anomaly when a special release (especially from one of Kentucky’s majors) sits on the shelves well outside its release window possibly because of a perceived dip in quality. Has there been a real dip in quality of the company’s output or is nostalgia getting the better part of many long time bourbon drinkers?

To shed some light on this idea and to try and to put Russell’s Reserve 1998 into some context, I drank it side by side with an early 1990’s gold foil Wild Turkey 101 12 Year and a 2015 bottle of Wild Turkey 101.

Both the 1990 and 1998 bottles contained the flavor richness and cherry forwardness that is common with older Wild Turkey bourbons and is what people probably remember most about them. The 1998 with three extra years of aging actually did a better job balancing its fruit notes and provided extra layers of depth. It’s finish was also much more oak-forward and long lasting. The 1990 and 2015 bottles had a lot of basic flavor characteristics in common and both were extremely easy to drink thanks to their sweet flavors, but the 1990 had an additional flavor intensity that is absent from the 2015 bottle.

It’s hard to pull any absolutes from this comparison since we’ll never know for sure how nurtured the 1990 bottle was, and the 2015 bottle doesn’t have an age statement and is probably a lot younger than the other two. A simple takeaway is Russell’s Reserve 1998 is the best of the bunch in every category. Despite multiple years of less-than-amazing releases, Russell’s Reserve 1998 is a true testament of how great Wild Turkey bourbon can still be.","Russell’s Reserve 1998 is part of a growing wave of premium priced bourbon that dares to break the $200 barrier that a few short years ago, seemed almost unreachable. In this new wallet-breaking category, bourbon lovers need to reevaluate what constitutes a good value. Bourbon drinkers can fight it as much as they want, but this new premium market isn’t going anywhere and is in fact growing each year.

The real question of value always starts with: Can you personally afford it or not? This is especially true in this price range. Companies that have the audacity to charge an exorbitant amount, are banking on the assumption that they have an exceptional product that can justify the price and weather any potential backlash. With Russell’s Reserve 1998 arguably being one of the best and rarest releases of 2015, is that enough to justify its $250 price point? You can personally accept the growing premium bourbon market or not, but it doesn’t change the fact that Russell’s Reserve 1998 is an exceptional bourbon and a higher price is therefore expected. At $250, you’re certainly not getting a deal no matter how amazing the bourbon is, but based on its exceptional quality, let’s just say, you’re not getting ripped off. Until the dust settles and a better understanding of this new pricing category is made, Russell’s Reserve 1998 joins a small group of pioneer bourbons in uncharted pricing territory. Despite its price, it’s also one that’s quality won’t be second guessed.",A delicious and respectable throwback to Wild Turkey’s heydays and hopefully a sign of things to come.,"Russell’s Reserve 1998 is simply one of the best bourbons Wild Turkey has released in many many years. While I didn’t need to compare it to other Wild Turkey releases to come to my conclusion, I provided a helpful context to the range of flavors and quality the brand has experienced over the years. In the end, Russell's Reserve 1998 truly speaks for itself. Where at times it seems like the Wild Turkey company has lost some confidence in itself, those who have had their past releases have not. Those drinkers are simply waiting for the sleeping giant to awaken. With only 2,070 bottles in this release, this might only be a slight opening of the eyes, but it’s proof that the greatness is still there and hopefully will come again soon.",Eric,4,4.5,4,3.5,2.5,4,https://www.breakingbourbon.com/review/russells-reserve-1998-bourbon
,Russell's Reserve 2002,Classification: Straight Bourbon,Company: Campari Group,Distillery: Wild Turkey,Released: July 2018,Proof: 114.6,Age: 15 Years,"Mashbill: 75% Corn, 13% Rye, 12% Malted Barley",Color: Medium Copper,MSRP: $250 (2016),Official Website,"Russell’s Reserve 2002 is the first non-chill filtered barrel proof bourbon released by the brand. The release is comprised of 25 barrels that had been aging in Wild Turkey’s offsite Camp Nelson rickhouses for 15 years. It’s a sequel to Russell’s Reserve 1998 with similar packaging. It’s also meant to pay homage to a milestone achieved this year: father-son master distillers Jimmy and Eddie Russell’s combined 101 years with Wild Turkey. Only 3,640 bottles were released to a total of 14 states: AZ, CA, FL, GA, IL, KY, NC, NV, NY, OH, OR, TN, TX, and WA.","Rich with honeyed oak, caramel, and vanilla forming the foundation. Seasoned wood and a splash of rye spice add dimension. 2002’s age is evident here, as the oak notes create the backbone, though it’s not overdone. The aromas are full in intensity, stripping away any dose of ethanol you might anticipate for the proof and making for a balanced and complex array of scents.","A pop of rye spice up front is followed by sweet notes of honey, caramel, and vanilla. Wood forms the base, with varying aspects of flavor - burnt wood, seasoned oak, and cigar box. Hints of leather and tobacco are also present. Notably, the rye spice up front carries through. While the flavors are a bit ad hoc, their overall complexity and depth make up for it. This results in a bold, interesting sip that’s punchy in its delivery of flavors, but also characteristically Wild Turkey.","Rye spice carries through, along with bouts of cinnamon spice. The sweeter caramel, honey, and vanilla notes also push into the finish, accompanied by an underlying array of oak. Spicy and long, the finish turns slightly dry towards the end. While it offers less complexity than the palate, it’s well executed overall.","Russell’s Reserve 2002 follows the trend started in 2016 with Russell’s Reserve 1998 - the barrel and resulting bottle count is very low. While 3,640 to 1998’s 2,070 is technically an increase, few would argue it’s a big enough increase to dramatically change their ability to locate a bottle. As a result, it’s limited in the same sense that 1998 was because the company chose to produce only so much of it, and that production number means it won’t be readily available.

Compared side by side with 1998, I wasn’t surprised by what I found. At 102.2 proof, 1998 is less punchy, but more refined. 2002 is more bold, spicy, and noticeably less balanced than 1998. But its big, complex flavor profile makes up for it. Overall they’re two bourbons that are equivalent in quality, but contrasting in how they deliver.

The fact that 2002 was released non-chill filtered and at barrel proof helps to maximize the flavors’ potential. However, these stats are not worlds away from the standard Russell’s Reserve Single Barrel release which is also non-chill filtered, bottled at 110 proof, and typically aged around 9 years.

Comparing 2002 to a bottle of Russell’s Reserve Single Barrel, I found 2002 edged out the Single Barrel in every way. Not surprisingly, the most notable difference is the additional complexity and maturity found in 2002, as compared with a more dominating spice found in Single Barrel.

While the comparison might seem academic, sadly I can’t say I always prefer the company’s limited releases to their standard releases. This is especially notable as I find Wild Turkey’s standard releases to be a high quality and some of my favorites. Diamond Anniversary and Master’s Keep 17 Year are examples of releases that were lacking in comparison. Fortunately, 2002 offers enough of a gain in every sense to say with conviction that it’s a better bourbon than anything Wild Turkey puts out on a regular basis.","When a limited release from a major distillery has such a small number, 3,640 bottles in this case, the value analysis has multiple, often conflicting, angles of approach. Russell’s Reserve 1998 also set a precedent at $250, and considering 2002 is not far off in terms of overall quality, retail price, and overall low bottle count, the same reaction from consumers can be expected. The bourbon inside the bottle is safely a notch or two above the readily available Russell’s Reserve Single Barrel, which clocks in around $50. To me, this is a win for Wild Turkey and reasonable at $250 given today’s market, but beyond that a higher consideration of value is certainly driven by other motivating factors or a “have-to-have-it” kind of attitude.","Russell’s Reserve 2002 is a full-flavored, complex, yet straightforward bourbon that takes everything you might love about Wild Turkey and dials it up a notch or two.","Russell’s Reserve 2002 is a really good bourbon. It shows what Wild Turkey is capable of, yet doesn’t break the mold of the characterically “Wild Turkey” flavor profile. Its higher proof brings with it more intense flavors, something nearly every Wild Turkey fan has a craving for. While the ethanol is well under control, its overall complexity overshadows a somewhat ad hoc delivery of flavors, which is really the only fault I can find with it. Fortunately, 2002 is another win for Wild Turkey. If you’re a Wild Turkey fan and happen to come across a bottle around MSRP, don’t hesitate to pull the trigger on this one.

,W.L. Weller 12 Year Bourbon,Classification: Straight Bourbon,"Company: Sazerac Company, Inc.",Distillery: Buffalo Trace,Released: Ongoing,Proof: 90,Age: 12 Years,Mashbill: Undisclosed,Color:  Bronze,MSRP: $30 (2016),Official Website,Our thoughts on the 2017 release can he found here.,"There’s almond, caramel and vanilla upfront, with oak and leather on the backend, that are all wrapped up in a sweet-to-the-nose package. Fainter hints of citrus also develop as the bourbon breaths.","It tastes very close to how it smells. All of the nuanced aromas of the nose also develop similarly on your tongue. It has a sweetness to it, yet never goes overboard as you think it might. There’s also a subtle amount of dryness arrives midway. The palate isn’t quite equal to the layered texture of the nose but it comes close.","It finishes with some spicy hotness but again, never goes overboard. The wheat’s sweetness is still present, but the finish is better characterized by its equal amount of dryness. It’s a nice balance between the two. Flavor wise, the caramel and vanilla are still present along with more oak. The medium in length finish is also medium in weight.","Weller 12 Year might the closest you can get to tasting Pappy Van Winkle. It comes from the same recipe as Van Winkle Lot B, which is also aged 12 years, but doesn't get the sweetest spots in the warehouses. For many people that’s enough to convince them to buy it. It’s also one of the few wheated bourbon on the market which put it into a category with few competitors. Of those competitors, 90% of them are from the same brand line. On top of that, it’s aged 12 years, far longer than most low cost bourbons.","If you take into account the uniqueness stated above and the fact that it’s a far better bourbon than many twice its price, you understand why it’s becoming so hard to find. At around $20-$25 for a 750ml bottle, it’s a flat-out steal. This is one bourbon that actually under-priced. It would have an easy time sitting along side many $40 bourbons.","Balanced, and sporting a great flavor profile, this is one bourbon that is far better than many in its price range.","Does it get better than this? Van Winkle recipe, aged 12 years, low price and an above-average nose/palate/finish? There are a very few bourbons that can flat-out beat it without blowing your budget. Also don’t let the Weller’s line of underwhelming bottle design and labels deter you from finding the gem. The money Buffalo Trace saves on the bottle itself is passed along to the consumer. As their shortages continue, if you see a bottle of W.L. Weller 12 Year, grab it. It might not immediately blow you away with gimmicks, but once you familiarize yourself with it, you're likely to become great friends.",Eric,3.5,3.5,3,3,5,4,https://www.breakingbourbon.com/review/w-l-weller-12-year-bourbon
In Depth Review,Weller Full Proof (2020),Classification: Straight Bourbon,Company: Sazerac Company,Distillery: Buffalo Trace,Release Date: Summer 2020 (Annual release),Proof: 114,Age: NAS,"Mashbill: Undisclosed (Buffalo Trace “Wheated” Mashbill - Corn, Wheat, Malted Barley)",Color: Mahogany,MSRP: $50 (2020),Official Website,"In June 2019, Buffalo Trace launched Weller Full Proof. Its “Full Proof” moniker doesn’t mean it's bottled at barrel proof, but instead that it is bottled at the same 114 proof that the original distillate was entered into the barrel at. Weller Full Proof joins the Weller family of products that include Weller Special Reserve, Weller Antique 107, Weller 12 Year, Weller C.Y.P.B., and Weller Single Barrel. William Larue Weller is also considered part of the Weller family, but is barrel proof and sports a different bottle and label design because it is released as part of the Buffalo Trace Antique Collection. Weller Full Proof will be released annually with a targeted summer release window.","You’re greeted with a wealth of delectable bakery scents upon pour. Pound cake, crumbled cinnamon and sugar, rich caramel, vanilla extract, and buttercream frosting combine to form a sugar fan’s dream aroma. Classically Weller through and through, with more sweetness being highlighted than other Weller offerings. It’s a bit on the gentle side given its proof, forcing a swirl of the glass to liven it up. This lack of overall intensity is the only thing that holds it back.","A bullish push of sweet vanilla, thick oak, and a cinnamon-caramel slurry demands immediate attention. It’s beautifully rich, with a mouth-coating thickness causing the flavors to stick and further open up over time. The palate nicely lands a cohesive balance between its lavish flavors and a proof that adequately shows them off.","A ramp up in heat causes the bourbon’s cinnamon notes to blossom. As they do, spice is slowly introduced, along with the development of a layer of thick oak. The combination of cinnamon, spice, and oak forms a long lasting and memorable finish that closes the bourbon on a satisfying note.","It’s hard to believe the Weller brand bourbons were once bottom shelf dwellers before becoming the highly desired and elite bourbons they are known as today. They are arguably some of the best wheated bourbons “available,” and few could argue against calling William Larue Weller the best barrel proof wheated bourbon on the market.

Despite Buffalo Trace producing an estimated 30-40k bottles per year of William Larue Weller, few ever get the opportunity to purchase one. A case could be made that adding another Weller release to Buffalo Trace’s portfolio will open up the opportunity for more to taste their high proof wheaters - and to a small degree this will probably be true - but in the cruel reality that is: few will ever see a Weller Full Proof.

That is of course a shame, since William Larue Weller, Weller 12 Year, and now Weller Full Proof are some of the best wheated bourbons on the market. Due to their popularity, there has been an uptick in companies releasing wheated bourbons in hopes of catching the wave of Pappy Van Winkle and Weller, but actually having a product people can buy. But the sad reality is, nothing quite tastes like William Larue Weller, Weller Full Proof, and the Van Winkle line for that matter.

Regardless of peoples distaste for Buffalo Trace as a company because of their heavy allocation of their products, they make a damn good wheated bourbon. While I noted the slide in quality of Weller 12 Year over the years, the fact still remains, no company can quite copy their buttery, sweet, fruity, and perfectly oaked wheated bourbons. After Nick found Weller C.Y.P.B. not overly exciting, I wasn’t going to be surprised if Weller Full Proof came across that way too. It didn’t end up that way, and while it may not be on the same level as William Larue Weller, its lower proof will allow it to be more palatable for most. Weller Full Proof is a great example of the heights wheated bourbons can reach and the disappointing reality that so few wheated bourbon actually ever reach it.","It’s never easy to discuss value when talking about in-demand, heavily allocated whiskeys from Buffalo Trace. They admirably (and also strangely) price their products far below market value. As evidenced by the incredible demand and soaring secondary prices, Sazerac is undoubtedly leaving a lot of money on the table. The company’s Buffalo Trace Antique Collection retails for $100, a far cry from what the market would be willing to pay even if they were readily available.

Weller Full Proof’s $50 MSRP is shockingly low for what it offers. It does feel like a throwback to the times when Weller was undervalued and was found on the bottom shelf for $20. But $50 for Weller Full Proof also sorta feels like a slap in the face only because of its rarity. Bourbon drinkers just aren’t conditioned to compute such an equation of a highly sought after bourbon of excellent quality at a rock bottom price.

The unfortunate reality for most is they will never come across it at MSRP and have to pay secondary prices. But in that same reality, even paying triple for Weller Full Proof in today’s market is still a great value for this bourbon. While only you can determine what your personal price threshold is, you can take some solace that Weller Full Proof offers an excellent pour that will justify a wide range of prices.","Weller Full Proof is a worthy addition to the Weller brand, and offers a rich and flavorful pour at a spot-on proof.","Weller Full Proof is a winner and for most releases it would end there, but the Weller brand has another side to it thanks to its insane popularity. For a company that cites shortages and sees heavy allocation of their products, they continually release new products, including a rapid expansion of their Weller brand. For consumers, it’s a frustration exchange and it’s hard to fault them for feeling a bit disenchanted with Buffalo Trace.

Desiring Weller bourbons and having an incredibly difficult time finding them is often a bitter pill to swallow, but the fact still remains they are great bourbons. Sure there are plenty of other great wheated bourbons available - with Maker’s Mark Cask Strength and Larceny Barrel Proof providing healthy competition, but ultimately coming up short against Weller Full Proof. The brand got its reputation because they are great bourbons first and great values second, and Weller Full Proof continues this tradition. I guess it's better to have a great bourbon that you desire that you might be able to find, versus a bad bourbon you loathe that you can always find.",Eric,3.5,4,4,3.5,4.5,4,https://www.breakingbourbon.com/review/weller-full-proof-2020
In Depth Review,WhistlePig The Boss Hog 2014 The Spirit of Mortimer,Classification: Rye,Company: WhistlePig,Distillery: Sourced,Released: Fall 2014,Proof: 119.5 (Single barrel release bottled at cask strength ranging from 117 - 124 proof),Age: 13.5 Years,Mashbill: 100% Rye,Color:  Medium Copper,MSRP: $189,Official Website,"This is the second “The Boss Hog” released by WhistlePig, the first was in 2013. According to the company, this year’s release has been selected from their oldest and most unique barrels - Bond 77. Bond 77 entered wood on April 5, 2001 and was part of a quadruple barrel aging process, including a combination of new American oak and early use bourbon barrels. This is a single barrel offering comprised of 50 barrels which were hand-selected and bottled at cask strength ranging from 117 - 124 proof. The bottle reviewed is from barrel #38, has a handwritten 13 year age statement, and was bottled at 119.5 proof.","Bright and lively. It’s definitely got rye spice on the nose, but less alcohol intensity than the proof would suggest. There’s a hint of anise along with something else… tobacco maybe. It’s faint but it’s there.","Very tasty. Full-bodied with a good mouthfeel. A warming rye pop hits immediately followed by a sweet and spicy kick. It’s bright and bold with elements of vanilla and oak underneath. It doesn’t taste over-aged by any means, which makes me wonder what a few more years in the barrel might bring.","Unlike the standard WhistlePig, there isn’t an intense rye pop in the finish. A hint of burnt brown sugar dances in the background, contrasting the rye spice.The flavors from the sip dissipate fairly evenly resulting in a balanced, medium-length finish. Overall it’s a nice finish to a fairly balanced and refined sip.","A single barrel, barrel proof, 13.5 year, 100% rye mash bill release comprised of 50 total barrels is very unique on paper. But how about the taste? My experience with WhistlePig’s standard offering had me anticipating something quite unique when it came to taste. Instead, my bottle offered a more mainstream flavor profile than I expected. In fact, the polarizing rye pop found in the standard WhistlePig’s finish was not present in this offering. I even tried proofing it down and could not achieve the same result. Aside from lacking that intensely unique rye pop in the finish, it’s still not quite like anything else I’ve tasted or have on my shelf… and I mean this in a good way.","I have a hard time justifying anything in excess of the $100 mark, so something approaching $200 is quite a stretch. If not for the current boom in the high-end whiskey market, this would never find it’s way out of a liquor store at this price point.

Let’s take Pappy Van Winkle 20 year as a comparable, as it also MSRPs in the mid $100 range. With the Pappy, the bourbon in the bottle is delicious, but there’s the outside influence as well that cannot be ignored. The hype somehow helps justify the pricing in our minds. When other people want something very desperately, we often find ourselves wanting it too. This is not true with The Boss Hog. The black label and pewter top are nice, but not $189 nice. There is no outside force or aftermarket insanity magically helping justify the price in our subconscious. Moreover, most of us have had little experience with The Boss Hog to know whether it’s worth the money or not.

Digging deeper into WhistlePig as a company does not make things any better. Although they’ve recently clarified things, WhistePig did not make it clear exactly where their product was from until more recently. The product is from one of three contracted distilleries in the U.S. or imported from one of two distilleries in Canada. Although the company’s grain to bottle concept is intriguing, it is not what’s in this year’s bottle of The Boss Hog. What we’re getting is a sourced whiskey bottled by a company in Vermont. That’s not very exciting.

The price point with this one requires a leap of faith. I took that leap. What I got in return is a high quality, unique offering that did not disappoint me. I don’t regret the purchase, but I also won’t be hunting for The Boss Hog next year. There’s just too much good whiskey to choose from for a lot less money.","A top notch offering from WhistlePig, although the price tag is a bit “hoggish.”","I’m a fan of ryes, so this one really intrigued me. The price is hard to ignore. $100 or less and I’m all in, but nearly double that? That’s a bit greedy. Ok, so price aside, let’s look at what’s in the bottle. The Boss Hog is a well rounded, balanced, and interesting barrel-proof expression of 100% rye mash with a fairly high age for a rye. It’s also very good. The end result is less polarizing than the standard WhistlePig offering. Because of this I would suggest trying The Boss Hog in a bar if you’ve had the standard WhistlePig and disliked it, but typically like ryes or barrel proof whiskeys in general. Those willing to shell out the bucks for a bottle should be those folks that really enjoy a spicy rye with a little extra coin to spare on this overpriced offering.",Nick,3,4.5,3.5,4.5,1.5,4,https://www.breakingbourbon.com/review/whistlepig-the-boss-hog-2014-the-spirit-of-mortimer

It really smells like something you would eat for dessert. Delicious and inviting.","Super sweet. Gingerbread and molasses play off maple sugar candy as the dominant flavor. Sickly-sweet marshmallowy, cotton candy-ish flavors push through towards the end of the sip. The sweetness from the rum casks dominates overall. A trace amount of rye spice is present, but much less so than what would be expected from a 95% rye mashbill. Because of this, it’s easy to sip.","Sugary sweetness lingers. Burnt maple sugar candy and molasses cookies play nicely at first, but then turns back to the sickly-sweet elements hinted on the palate. One of the longer finishes in a whiskey I’ve tasted, it starts nicely but over time morphs into a somewhat off-putting aftertaste. It’s not bad enough to ruin it, but enough to point out.","Over the past year or so we’ve experienced a “Finishing” explosion. The feedback from the community on the final products has been mixed. At Breaking Bourbon we’ve reviewed a number of these finished whiskeys with varied results: High West A Midwinter Night’s Dram, High West Double Rye Campfire Finish, Jefferson’s Ocean Aged at Sea 2, Jefferson’s Ocean Aged at Sea 3, Jefferson’s Ocean Aged at Sea 4, Michter’s Toasted Barrel Finish, Willett XCF, and Woodford Reserve Master’s Pinot Noir Finish.
With each of the aforementioned finished whiskeys I was fairly excited in anticipation of tasting for the first time, the reason: I wanted and expected to taste something different. As an onslaught of new whiskey labels come to market, few things are worse than spending $80 or more on a bottle of whiskey that doesn’t stand out from those available all year for under $30. Although potentially gimmicky or ripe with the risk of tasting terrible (sorry Woodford Pinot Noir Finish), finished whiskeys offer up the possibility of a unique flavor profile that can give enthusiasts the diversity we’re looking for. When I open my whiskey closet I don’t reach for my favorite whiskey, I reach for the one that suits my current mood. One thing is important to keep in mind, Angel’s Envy only does whiskey finishing and has been doing it since their inception. To them finishing isn’t just a one-off release, it’s what they set out to do with every one of their expressions so far. This particular expression hits the nail on the head when it comes to uniqueness. Rather than imparting just a slight hint of rum flavors, Angel’s Envy pushes the limits and takes it to what might be considered the edge of perfection and (possibly) overdoing it. This is the rub, because fans may find themselves on one side or the other - maybe even teetering back and forth. When I first tasted this I didn’t know if I loved it or hated it. Fortunately after about a half bottle later it’s had time to air out. The sickly-sweetness that was overpowering at first has subdued to a manageable level, which has allowed this whiskey to grow on me.","Finished whiskeys receive some of their criticism as a result of their pricing. Like this 6-7 year old sourced whiskey, they are often relatively young, sourced, and arguably over-hyped. The aforementioned list of finished whiskeys we’ve reviewed were not cheap, ranging in price from $50 - $140, with most in the $80 - $100 range. Willett XCF is a very close comparison - also sourced from MGP, same mashbill, about 7 years old, and finish-aged for about 90 days (vs. Angels Envy [up to] 18 months). It’s MSRP is $140. Considering this, the Angel’s Envy Rye is priced to move and based on some people’s claims that it is “The best whiskey they’ve ever had” there is certainly a market for it. The [up to] 18 month finishing time is also longer than the norm, suggesting that Angel’s Envy tasters were insistent on achieving what they believe to be the perfect flavor profile even if it takes a little extra time. To further put this duration of finishing into perspective, keep in mind that many craft whiskies aren’t even aged for 18 months total!","Angel’s Envy Rye pushes the rum barrel finishing to the edge, resulting in a premium quality finished rye with a flavor profile so unique you’ll need to taste it for yourself to find out if you love it or hate it.","Angel’s Envy Rye is a unique, premium quality experience in barrel finished whiskey. If whiskey could be a dessert, this would be it. My prediction is most will either love it or hate it, while a few will find themselves somewhere in the middle as I am because the end result is seriously polarizing. As with any whiskey you need to taste it for yourself to develop your own opinion, but this advice cannot be overstated here. Furthermore, if you’re listening Wes, I do hope to see a cask strength version of this finished rye released in the near future. I have a feeling it could offer up a truly unique experience and fans would clamour for it with good reason, not just because it’s a new label in a cool bottle.",Nick,4.5,3.5,2.5,4.5,4,3.5,https://www.breakingbourbon.com/review/angels-envy-finished-rye
,Baker’s 13-Year-Old Single Barrel,Classification: Straight Bourbon,Company: Beam Suntory,Distillery: Jim Beam,Release Date: Fall 2019,Proof: 107,Age: 13 Years,"Mashbill: 77% Corn, 13% Rye, 10% Malted Barley",Color: Rust,Price: $100 (2019),Official Website,"Baker’s Bourbon is named after Baker Beam, grandnephew of the legendary Jim Beam. Baker’s Bourbon is one of four bourbons that comprise Jim Beam’s Small Batch Bourbon Collection. The others in the series are Basil Hayden’s, Knob Creek, and Booker’s Bourbon.

In October 2019, Jim Beam announced Baker’s would undergo a packaging redesign and transition to single barrel, exclusively. The standard version would maintain its 107 proof and 7 year age statement. Additionally, a 13 year old version, also single barrel and 107 proof, would be released in limited quantities. This 13 year old version is Baker’s first ever limited edition. In addition to the new bottle design, the 13 year old is released with a gift box.

The bottle in review is from barrel #222010.","Summer fruit combines with caramel chews, vanilla, and a dash of cinnamon to form the base of aromas. Traces of barrel char and musty funk weave in and out, hinting towards the bourbon’s age. Ethanol is present at first, but given adequate time in the glass, dissipates entirely allowing the aromas to come through with more force.","An immediate pop of rye spice is followed by a rush of raisins, caramel, and summer fruits. Leather, seasoned oak, and barrel char manifest beneath a layer of toasted marshmallow. It’s just the right amount of intensity and the sweet-spice-oak balance is on point.","Allspice and musty oak are countered with a caramel-butterscotch sweetness. The finish becomes a bit dry as it lingers. The spice and sweet flavors serve the bourbon well, keeping the wood flavors in check while nicely showcasing the bourbon’s age. Enjoyable overall.","I’m excited to see Jim Beam reinvigorating the Baker’s brand. The transition to single barrel brings with it the opportunity to experience a bit more variation between bottlings, and in turn hopefully find some gems. Notably, Beam’s Knob Creek Single Barrel Select program has revealed some fantastic barrels, and I’ve yet to come across one I didn’t like. While these barrels typically start at 9 years of age, more recently they have been found in the 14 year old range, give or take.

This limited edition 13 year old Baker’s shares the same mashbill as Knob Creek, but comes in at 107 proof versus Knob Creek Single Barrel Select’s 120. Baker’s offers a different flavor profile, but all things considered is not strikingly different from higher aged Knob Creek barrels, especially if you water Knob Creek down a bit.

Barrell Bourbon is also known for releasing 14 year old single barrels, and even at barrel proof they often fall in the 100 - 110 proof range. Notably, they typically originate from Tennessee and the flavor profile is different than what Baker’s serves up here. Like Barrell Bourbon, other brands such as Resilient and Treaty Oak have been releasing 13 to 15 year old single barrels sourced from Tennessee recently as well.

With Baker’s 13-Year-Old, the flavor profile is what I’d describe as traditional, quintessential bourbon. This contrasts most of the older Tennessee single barrels that have proliferated lately, and while not as good as Knob Creek Single Barrel Select barrels can be, might be more realistically sustainable at such a high age. Baker's 13-Year-Old plays off the base of flavors we’ve come to know with the now retired 7 year old Baker’s Small Batch Bourbon, not surprisingly adding noticeable wood influence to the mix.","A limited edition 13 year old release from a major distillery is, generally speaking, a pretty solid offering in today's marketplace. $100 for this limited edition is the right price, and I feel Jim Beam balanced value, quality, age, its limited quantity, the price point of the standard 7 year old version, and new upscale packaging design well. However, Jim Beam also puts out fantastic whiskey with their Knob Creek Single Barrel Select program, and by comparison I would take one of those at half the price over Baker’s 13-Year-Old any day even if the Knob Creek was on the younger side. But just because Beam produces another great whiskey at such an insanely good value doesn’t make Baker’s 13-Year-Old a bottle to avoid. While I don’t see myself forking over $100 for this on a regular basis, I don’t regret paying the price for the bottle I have.",Baker’s 13-Year-Old is a quintessential premium priced limited edition single barrel Kentucky bourbon that will help elevate the Baker’s Bourbon brand.,"Baker’s 13-Year-Old delivers a quintessential bourbon flavor profile with nice balance. It's certainly hard to dislike and grew on me the more I drank it. However, something about it kept gnawing at me the more I analyzed it. The best I can describe it - Jim Beam played it safe. Maybe it’s the particular barrel, its 107 proofpoint keeping its intensity of flavors in check, or something else. But ultimately, it plays it safe and stays in its lane. Some will gravitate towards this and appreciate it, while others will seek more thought-provoking or bombastic bourbon flavor profiles. It is a good, classic bourbon that has everything you could ask for on paper. But at $100 and being a limited release, it’s just not as exciting as I wished it would be. Here’s hoping the variety of flavor profiles from barrel to barrel overcomes that.",Nick,3,3.5,3.5,3,2.5,3.5,https://www.breakingbourbon.com/review/bakers-13-year-old-single-barrel
,Balcones Texas Rye,Classification: Rye,Company: Balcones Distilling,Distillery: Balcones Distilling,Release Date: Ongoing,Proof: 100,Age: Aged at least 15 months,Mashbill: 100% Rye,Color: Bronze,MSRP: $40 (2019),Official Website,"Balcones is located in Waco Texas, and has been producing whisky since 2008. Notably, Balcones uses the “whisky” spelling versus the typical American spelling of “whiskey.” One thing that helps them stand out from other distilleries is they use unusual grains. For their Texas Rye, multiple types of rye grains are used in the mashbill, including elbon rye from northwest Texas, along with crystal, chocolate, and roasted rye. The exact percentages of each rye are not provided by Balcones.

The bottle being reviewed comes from batch RYE10018-3 with a date of 8/14/18.","A large dose of rye grain slathered in chocolate is instantly noticeable. Inhaling deeper pulls out more classic rye scents along with a hint of salted caramel, malted grains, and a touch of smoke. These scents lead to Texas Rye’s nose having a different aroma than what you would expect from a rye having 100% rye, or close to that, in its mashbill. Don’t take different for bad, as in this case the large dose of chocolate rye presents a delicious start.","The sip provides a lighter, yet flavor-rich mouthfeel. Rye spice and chocolate combine to form a spicy chocolate that’s akin to a piece of chili mexican chocolate. More chocolate is added in and takes form as a chocolate malt ball, along with the slightest touch of oak. The interplay of spice and chocolate is dominant, as these rich flavors overpower others that may be present. In this case however, it just works, as the balance is spot on producing a palate that makes you want to continuously go back for more.","The finish continues what the palate started, with spiced chocolate and chocolate malt balls to start things off. These transition to a lighter chocolate note that is combined with leather and oak. The flavors eventually taper down to a long lingering note of rye grain and damp oak. It’s not as bold as the palate, yet it’s a satisfying way to end the sip.","Balcones has been a staple in the American whiskey scene now for over 10 years and it’s at the stage of its life where it is teetering on still being labeled craft by some, and as a well established staple by others. Their claim to fame is their use of unique grains, and that is quite evident in Texas Rye. The use of multiple variations of ryes pulls forward a flavor profile that is both unique and somehow feels appropriate coming from a Texas distillery. The resulting sip is one that you can easily envision yourself enjoying on a back porch on a hot Texas night.

Texas Rye is unlike any other rye currently in the marketplace. The sip provides the spice that rye lovers crave, but with the bold addition of rich chocolate notes throughout. More impressive; it does all of this with less than two years of aging and little to no typical youthful flavor notes present. Not too many whiskeys are able to manage this, but Texas Rye knocks it out of the park in this area.  ","A low age statement from a Texas distillery doesn’t exactly scream value. However, in Texas Rye’s case, $40 is a more than reasonable price to pay for this whiskey. The flavor profile is bold and flavorful, delivering a rich sip that is easy to go back for “just one more.” Texas Rye delivers a sip that is unlike many in the market, and easily supports the asking price.",A quirky all-rye mashbill delivers a memorable rich sip from the heart of Texas.,"Balcones Texas Rye is an incredibly easy sipper that simply put, is “tasty.” I found its spicy chocolatey flavor profile an uncommon yet welcome reprieve to the ryes I’ve tasted this year. Short of not being a fan of chocolate, most will find enjoyment with its unexpected flavor profile. While it’s young in age, in this case I don’t know if the flavor profile would hold up if it spent more time in the barrel. Instead, Balcones seems to have found the perfect sweet spot for when to bottle, resulting in a rye that is an easy recommendation.",Jordan,3.5,4,3.5,4.5,3,3.5,https://www.breakingbourbon.com/review/balcones-texas-rye
,Balcones True Blue Cask Strength,Classification: Corn Whisky,Company: Balcones,Distillery: Balcones,Released: Ongoing,Proof: 116.6,Age: NAS,Mashbill: 100% Corn,Color:  Deep Dark Amber,MSRP: $54 (2016),Official Website,"Balcones is a craft distillery in Waco Texas that has been producing “whisky” since 2008. I say “whisky” because Balcones classifies their products this way versus the typical American spelling of “whiskey”. One thing that helps them stand out from the craft distillery pack is they use unusual grains when making their products. In the case of True Blue Cask Strength, it is made from 100% roasted blue corn. True Blue is a cask strength whiskey which can vary by proof depending on what batch you try. The bottle being reviewed came from batch number TB13-2, dated 3/15/13, and distilled by CT. It should be noted that it was produced by the company’s founder Chip Tate, before he parted ways with the distillery in late 2014.","Not knowing what to expect out of a 100% roasted blue corn whisky, I’m really surprised at the depth of the nose. As would be expected from a 100% corn whiskey, corn is definitely present however not as much as you would usually find in a younger whiskey. Sweet maple sugar candy immediately jumps out followed by dried corn mixed with aged tobacco, light raisins mixed with pecans, light chocolate espresso, and something I can’t put my finger on that is akin to the smell of a fresh poured cask ale. There’s no hint of alcohol whatsoever, which is really surprising since it’s bottled at 116.6 proof. It sounds like a strange combination of smells, but the best way to sum up the nose is “deeply rich” and satisfying. The profile is so different than what I’m used to with a whiskey, that it kept sucking me back in throughout the review. Really a nice treat and in my mind, the high point of this whiskey.","The palate is sweeter than I expected. Corn is noticeably present, however so are sweet raisins mixed with brown sugar, pecans, and maple syrup, along with a subtle dose of white pepper. I’m almost tempted to make pancakes one day and pair it with this whiskey. It’s not quite as sweet as say something like Angel's Envy Rye, however it is definitely sweeter than the nose would lead you to believe. Like the nose, there was barely any alcohol noticeable in the palate which is a nice surprise considering the proof.","This is one earthy dry finish. It starts with bark, aged oak, hints of dark chocolate (think 85% cocoa), aged tobacco, dried leather, and fresh ground green pepper. It then mellows out into just an earthy peppery finish that lingers for a while. It’s worth noting that the finish is relatively isolated, and started and died in my mouth rather than moving down into my throat or stomach. After the great nose and sweet palate, I was looking forward to the finish, however it didn’t live up to the task. Average at best, it doesn’t seem to push this whiskey forward as much as the nose and palate.","Balcones isn’t the only craft distillery producing a 100% corn whiskey. Among others there is Copper Craft in Michigan, as well as Hudson Distillery with their Baby Bourbon line. That being said, Balcones tastes like nothing else on the market. I’m not sure if it’s the fact that they use roasted blue corn or that Chip Tate set them up on the road to success, but True Blue Cask Strength is definitely unique like none other I’ve tasted. Similar in sweetness to a watered down Angel’s Envy Rye, the flavor profile produced from a 100% corn based whiskey was really eye opening.

Additionally while no age statement is present and this is most likely a younger whiskey (my guess is 18-24 months), I was surprised at the depth of the flavor profile it delivers. Many craft whiskeys in that age range usually don’t taste great and rarely match the hype put out by distilleries , however for Balcones True Blue Cask Strength, that doesn’t seem to be the case. Compared to other craft whiskeys around the same age, it’s full of deep flavor and really delivers a rich unique taste.","At around $55 you’re taking a gamble on a NAS 100% corn whisky. Yes it’s cask strength, but there are plenty of great bourbons and ryes in the marketplace to grab your attention in that price range. My thoughts on this are similar to Stranahan’s which comes in around the same price. It’s a craft distilled product that is trying to command a price that isn’t in line with current well established whiskey products in the market. Along with Stranahan’s, I would prefer to see this priced at $45 to make it more accessible to those looking to add some variety to their collections.

Additionally, Balcones has been in a large state of flux over the last few years. From the Chip Tate saga, to the new distillery, the wild temperature swings of Waco Texas and the types of woods used in their various sized barrels, you should expect a lot of variation between batches. This variation should eventually even out as the new distillery continues to ramp up and Balcones continues to grow its brand. That said, for now you’re taking a gamble when you buy a bottle of True Blue Cask Strength. If you happen to have this at a bar or at a friend’s place and like it, make note of the batch number and try to hunt down a bottle from that same batch.","100% Corn, Young, and Craft….everything screams stay away, however Balcones True Blue Cask Strength delivers a rewarding experience to those who choose to give it a shot."," I walked away from this review with a new appreciation of what can be done with a mashbill of just corn. Balcones True Blue Cask Strength really brought forward a flavor profile and richness that I wasn’t expecting out of a craft distiller that was using just corn and aging in the high heat of Waco, Texas. While the whiskey slowly lost steam from the palate through the finish, it delivered a much richer experience than I had originally expected.

True the price is high for what you can find on the market, and for me this is more of a once in awhile whiskey versus an everyday sipper. That being said, it really makes me want to explore more of the Balcones line and keep an eye on what they plan on delivering in the future. This is worth a try, even if you just have it in a bar one time, so that you can experience a totally different whiskey experience than one you might normally be used to. For me, this is one craft distiller that I hope makes it through this current craft boom.",Jordan,4,3,2.5,4,2.5,3.5,https://www.breakingbourbon.com/review/balcones-true-blue-cask-strength

The bottle in review is from Batch 007, bottle number 5002. It was distilled and aged in Tennessee, in American white oak barrels with a Char #4.","Scents of grains and sweet corn are at the forefront, wrapped in citrusy orange peel. A sting from the alcohol is present as much as would be expected for the proof. While not unpleasant, its aroma is not overly inviting either.","Spice takes the lead, with a smattering of raw grains and buttery cornbread. It has a nice mouthfeel with a bit of a tingle on the tongue. Sweet citrus and seasoned wood come out from behind the initial flavors leading into the finish.","Nice and spicy. The citrus and seasoned wood that teased the tastebuds on the palate dominate at the start of the finish, making for a nice combination. The seasoned wood progressively overshadows the other flavors as they dissipate, making for a long, dry, and enjoyable finish.","For the first few pours I drank this on its own. However, the spiciness of it reminded me of Batch 005, so I poured some of the last few drops I had of Batch 005 for a side-by-side comparison. To my surprise, I still noticed more spice and a bit more depth with Batch 005.

Being of similar heritage, I poured some Batch 006 for a comparison as well. While I noticed echoes of flavor similarities, the lack of refinement with Batch 007 was more evident against the backdrop of Batch 006. At 5 years old compared with 8.5 years that’s to be expected, though Batch 007’s youth isn’t necessarily a bad thing. In fact, it offers a unique comparison with its recent predecessors, almost filling a gap on a flavor profile in a way that allows us to experience different shades of a similar color.","Each batch of Barrell Bourbon has some inherent value simply based on its unique flavor profile, limited production, and careful curation with high level of attention to the details. Barrell’s “every batch is unique” mantra is both a gift and a curse for the brand, as it is nearly impossible to avoid comparison with the previous batches (immediately passing judgement on value), yet eager fans will be compelled to try the next batch creating an inherent demand. However, as more batches continue to be released, we have to consciously value each individually based on its own merits, not just how it compares to its predecessors. While Batch 007 is not quite the exceptional experience Batch 006 was, it is still a quality barrel proof bourbon packed full of flavor. Despite this, at $90 it’s a tad overpriced, as I would prefer to see it at around $75. Fortunately, it’s not unusual to see Barrel Bourbon priced for a bit less than MSRP.","Barrell Bourbon continues to impress with another tasty batch of bourbon, albeit a bit less refined than its most recent predecessors.","Joe Beatrice continues to impress with another tasty batch of bourbon. With so much recent press and a following that is on its way to achieving cult-like status, it’s great to see quality batch after batch even if this one doesn’t quite match that of its predecessors.

Being Batch 007, I can’t end my review without an obligatory James Bond reference, and in so doing will attempt to cast the most recent Barrell bourbons as their best characterized “Bonds.” While the recent Barrell Bourbon Batches 005 and 006 might be cast as the more debonaire Connery or Brosnan, the “007” Batch would most certainly be cast as the more primal Daniel Craig!

The spices tingle my nostrils, with an expected amount of alcohol for the proof. Pleasant overall.","An interplay between baking spices and buttered cornbread is most prominent. It’s rather sweet, and offers a healthy amount of spicy heat as might be expected for the proof. Traces of popcorn and seasoned wood come into play towards the end of the sip. It’s big and bold, delivering the flavors in a straightforward way that should satisfy most barrel proof cravings.","The finish is relatively long lasting, and just as straightforward as the rest of the sip. Baking spices taper off along with buttered cornbread and more prominent seasoned wood towards the end, though it’s less oak influence than you might expect for a 9 year old bourbon. It’s a nice finish overall that maintains balance with the rest of the sip.","Batch 008 has the same mashbill as Batch 007, and based on what Barrell has shared, a similar origin as Batch 007. While Batch 008 is four years older than Batch 007, the oak influence is no more prominent. The more batches of Barrell Bourbon I try, the more I’ve come to expect similar underlying characteristics. However, the final delivery is unique to each batch. This might just be a good balance, as I have some idea what general characteristics the bourbon might have, but the experience is just different enough from batch to batch to hold my interest. It’s similar to the range of flavor variation among private selection single barrels of the same brand.

The burning question is how this compares with Barrell Batch 006, which is my favorite batch so far and widely recognized as a standout. Batch 006 is more complex, less bold, and its overall delivery is more refined. Batch 008 is more bold, a little more rough in its delivery, and doesn’t match the complexity of Batch 006. But it’s still really good, and those who like something a bit bolder might even prefer Batch 008 to Batch 006.","Bourbon prices continue to rise and that’s OK as long as quality comes with it. For those who enjoy the flavor characteristics of Barrell’s Tennessee sourced bourbons, Batch 008 will not disappoint. Barrell’s bourbons are priced at a premium and as a result shouldn’t be confused as everyday drinkers, at least for those of us that consider $90 a lot for bourbon. It’s a unique tasting bourbon that’s carefully sourced and carefully curated with quality in mind.

How long then before it gains cult status?

Barrell Craft Spirits has done a good job with all of their products, making sure no two batches taste alike. Although some could claim that’s an easy feat when a company procures all of their products from different sources, the harder part is continually offering something that’s unique tasting and high quality. This is where the majority of new NDP products ultimately fail, as it’s much easier said than done. The company has been on a string of great releases, but more specifically, their bourbon line has continued to be some of the best bourbons on the market batch after batch. Batch 012 might not offer a different tasting flavor profile that turns heads (like Batch 010 did), it simply offers crowd-pleasing flavors that are straightforward and easy to enjoy.","Barrell Bourbon Batch 012 is another quality bourbon that is simply hard to beat for the price. There is always a risk with any bourbon purchase that it might be a letdown, but after 12 releases, there seems to be less risk involved when purchasing a Barrell Bourbon based on the company’s track record. Where the first few batches of Barrell Bourbon weren’t particularly noteworthy, all of the batches we’ve reviewed have rated on the high end of our scale. With Batch 012 falling once again right in that same range, debating if $90 is too expensive for these releases is quickly becoming a moot point.","After a string of great releases, Batch 012 cements Barrell Bourbon’s standing as a leader in its price range.","As we just came off the excellent Barrell Bourbon Batch 011, it's natural to feel that it was an anomaly and the follow-up wouldn’t have anything to offer. It’s certainly true that Batch 012 doesn’t reach the heights of Batch 011, but to my surprise, I find it to be one of the better bourbons I’ve had recently (and that includes bourbons that are more expensive). Sure $90 might be a lot to spend on any bourbon, but that’s simply what really good bourbon costs nowadays. By putting it into perspective, Batch 012 is easily better than the majority of $60 bourbons on the market, and despite not sporting any traits that make it overly unique, it’s still one of the better bourbons you can buy under $100. If you haven’t been taking the Barrell Bourbon releases seriously you should start to. After a number of high quality releases, the brand continues with its excellent track record and is absolutely worth the attention of any serious bourbon drinker.

,Barrell Bourbon Batch 013,Classification: Bourbon,Company: Barrell Craft Spirits,Distillery: Sourced (From undisclosed distilleries in Indiana and Tennessee),Released: September 2017,Proof: 113,Age: Blend of 5 and 8 year old bourbons,"Mashbill: Undisclosed (includes corn, rye [high and low], and malted barley)",Color:  Golden Straw,MSRP: $90 (2017),Official Website,"Barrell Bourbon is sourced bourbon released periodically in sequentially numbered batches. The company’s mantra is to seek out unique whiskeys and release them at barrel proof, striving to offer no two batches that are alike.

According to the company’s website, “Batch 013 is the combination of a 5 year-old Indiana bourbon and 5 and 8 year-old high rye Tennessee bourbons. The 5 year-old barrels were chosen for their brilliant corn-forward flavor and the 8 year old to provide structure and depth.”","Equal bouts of toasted almond, leather, and orange comprise this rather interesting nose. There are quick hints of youth that spring up, yet the leather notes provide a solid counterpoint to them. Cocoa and cedar also make ever-so-brief appearances and keep this bourbon’s nose grounded.","A full flavored burst of cigar, tobacco, and seasoned spice. In fact, the spice element unfolds further with notes of anise and cinnamon. It’s a respectable display of flavors that leans heavily on spicy notes to add a lot of complexity to its palate. The rye grain influence is evident, as there aren’t many sweet flavors involved and those that are take a backseat to the spicier ones.","A long and warm finish that introduces black pepper, clove, and an herbal aspect as it trails off. There’s a nice amount of burn and the aftertaste stays true to what the palate offers. Overall the finish is a nice companion to the palate as it continues what it started and offers additional layers of complexity.","A lot of bourbons tend to lean on the sweet side of the flavor spectrum. That of course has do with what bourbon is made of (at least 51% corn, often more) and how it is aged. Where older bourbons tend to lose some of their sweetness due to the extended time aging in a barrel, this isn’t always the case with younger bourbon. It’s certainly not uncommon to taste heavier flavor notes of vanilla and caramel in many bourbons aged under 10 years. So when a younger bourbon comes around and those flavors aren’t at the forefront, it’s worth taking extra notice.

When a company like Barrell Craft Spirits is constantly putting out products that don’t have to adhere to a repeatable flavor profile, unique batches are bound to come up. Where Batches 006, 009, and 011 all had very agreeable flavor profiles that almost anyone could love, Batch 013, like Batch 010, stands out for its uniqueness. But this is also a recipe for a large discrepancy of opinions on the bourbon. Batch 013 isn’t so odd that bourbon drinkers won’t “get it,” it just doesn’t quite conform to traditional expectations for a bourbon with a 5 year age statement on its label.","If “heavy and complex spice notes” sounds good to you, then Batch 013 will come off as a fair value. If being adventurous appeals to you, then this will be a fair value to you too. If you’re looking for traditional bourbon flavor profile more in line with the rich and agreeable flavors found in other notable Barrell Bourbon batches, then you’ll probably not be satisfied with Batch 013’s value. From a high level perspective, Batch 013 is going to be a harder sell for most people. While I wouldn’t feel like I got ripped off at its MSRP, $90 for this batch is pushing my personal threshold for what’s in the bottle despite really enjoying its spicy complexity.",A robust spice-filled offering that surprises with its complexity and uniqueness.,"Batch 013 is being released at the perfect time of year. With its stronger flavor notes leaning heavily on spice, you could call this a harvest bourbon. Where every company comes out with a spiced product during the fall season, why shouldn’t bourbon do the same? It actually makes a lot of sense as days get shorter and the weather cools down, a heavier and spicier bourbon might hit the spot. Batch 013 might seem young on paper for its asking price, but as Barrell has proven, batching bourbons from different sources can have fascinating results. This might not be the best batch introduced byBarrell Bourbon, but it will give you a glimpse at what unique traits Barrell Bourbon batches can offer. For others, this might be another curious offering by the company that is increasingly becoming a loot box of bourbon releases. You never know what you’re going to get and they might not all be winners, but they’re almost always something different, interesting, and surprising.

,Barrell Whiskey American Vatted Malt,Classification: Whiskey,Company: Barrell Craft Spirits,"Distillery: Distilled in New York, Texas, Indiana, New Mexico, Washington & Arizona (Includes, but is not limited to, Balcones Distillery, Hamilton Distillers Del Bac, MGP, Harvest Distillery, Santa Fe Distillery, and Kings County Distillery)",Release Date: August 2019,Proof: 117.5,Age: 1.5 - 8 Years,Mashbill: 100% Malted Barley,Color: Orange Copper,Price: $90 (2019),Official Website,"American Vatted Malt is Barrell Craft Spirits’ first release in the category. The Scots historically referred to the combining of single malts to make a scotch as “Vatting,” and the name pays homage to the Scots’ traditional terminology which has since been replaced by the term “Blending.” Comprised of eight different American single malt whiskeys from six different U.S. states, the majority are craft distilleries not typically providing a component within another company’s blend. This release is marked with a bottling date, June 25, 2019. If subsequent batches are produced it’s anticipated that a bottling date will designate the particular batch as opposed to batch numbers customary with other Barrell Craft Spirits products. See the company press release for more information.","Licorice, raisins, and baking spices rest on a bed of malted barley. A hint of smoke is also present. The proof is hidden behind the rich scents, though a trace of ethanol peeks through. Interesting and inviting.","Chocolate, tobacco leaves, lightly roasted malt, and seasoned oak alongside sweeter butterscotch and anise notes are the first to grab my attention. They fold over one another comprising the base. A smoky element further complements these flavors, and is joined by a nuttiness which helps round things out. The proof is well hidden, but shows through in the richness of the sip. It offers a creamy mouthfeel, making for a superb palate.","Spice pops first in the long finish, with raisins and anise lingering after the initial spike. By comparison, the finish is less complex than the palate, but still enjoyable overall.","According to company founder Joe Beatrice, American Vatted Malt is a project long in the making. It includes components from all over the country, some of which are from up-and-coming distilleries. The age of single malts in the vat ranges from 1.5 - 8 years.

Single malts have deep roots in scotch. However, in the United States, the category could still be described as “up-and-coming” despite being around for quite awhile. Malt whiskey is defined as containing at least 51% malted barley and must be stored in new charred oak containers, similar to bourbon’s 51% corn and new charred oak storage requirement. Rye malt, straight malt, and straight rye malt are also further defined, extrapolating from the definition of malt whiskey. American single malt whiskey however, is not defined officially in the regulations. Because aging malt whiskey in used cooperage is often favored when using the cereal grain, the components within this blend don’t necessarily qualify as malt whiskeys by United States’ current definition. As a result of this lack of definition within the regulations, producers have joined together to more clearly define the category, creating the American Single Malt Whiskey Commission.

While we have experienced a growing “malt whiskey” category in the United States, it has been predominantly craft distilleries and limited distribution. However, distilleries such as Stranahan’s out of Denver, Colorado and Westland out of Seattle, Washington have made malt a focal point, producing whiskeys that have been well-received and become more widely distributed. In 2015 Heaven Hill released Parker’s Heritage Collection Straight Malt Whiskey, an 8 year 108 proof straight malt whiskey with a 65% malt, 35% corn mashbill which offered a flavor profile that was hard to dislike, though relatively safe within the space. The only current major U.S. distillery releasing an ongoing malt whiskey is Brown-Forman, with their Woodford Reserve Straight Malt Whiskey.

While malt whiskey has grown more common (or at least the use of higher percentages of malt in the mashbill), blending or “vatting” from a wide range of distilleries, however, is not so common in the United States. Notably, blending is Barrell Craft Spirits’ strength, and it’s showcased very well here with the resulting depth and complexity of flavors captured with this whiskey.","While some simply take another’s product and bottle it with little attention to blending, Barrell Craft Spirits excels at meticulously blending base component whiskeys to create something better. While I can’t necessarily compare the base whiskeys used in this blend to the final product, I can say with confidence that the final product is a good one. Talking with Beatrice, like anything new and a bit different, he was unsure how it would be received. However, he also believes the American single malt category has a lot of potential. He noted many craft distillers come from the beer industry, where they are often experienced working with malted grains, which are generally forgiving to begin with.

Of the quality malt-based whiskeys I’ve had, the pricing has generally been $50 or more. Higher proof options are much less common than their bourbon and rye counterparts, and often come with an increase in price. While American Vatted Malt includes a component that is as little as 1.5 years old, the components run up to 8 years. The percentages are not disclosed by Barrell, but there isn’t any indication of youth in the sip. Ultimately, while Vatted Malt is premium-priced at $90, it delivers.","Enjoyable and layered in complexity, American Vatted Malt is an inspired release that’s full of flavor and unlike any Barrell Craft Spirits has previously released.","American Single Malt is not yet a legally defined category in the United States. However, with a growing number of distilleries experimenting with malt as the dominant or only ingredient, the malt category has a great deal of potential. American Vatted Malt combines single malt whiskeys from around the United States, many from craft distilleries. What results is a complex blend of American single malts that delivers. While this type of whiskey might be new territory for some bourbon drinkers, it’s one worth exploring. If you appreciate Barrell’s other higher proof offerings and don’t mind the splurge, American Vatted Malt is a good place to start exploring malt-based whiskeys.

,Barrell Whiskey Batch 004,Classification: Whiskey,Company: Barrell Craft Spirits,Distillery: Sourced (From undisclosed distilleries in Indiana & Tennessee),Released: March 2017,Proof: 120.6,Age: 11 Years,"Mashbill: Undisclosed amounts of Corn, Rye, and Malted Barley",Color:  Yellow Gold,MSRP: $65 (2017),Official Website,"Barrell Whiskey is sourced whiskey released periodically in sequentially numbered batches. The company’s mantra is to seek out unique spirits and release them at barrel proof, striving to offer no two batches that are alike.

Barrell Whiskey Batch 004 is comprised of a Tennessee bourbon aged in excess of 11 years and an Indiana whiskey aged for 11 years, before finishing and bottling at cask strength. Separately, the whiskey and bourbon were finished in either rum casks left over from Barrell Rum Batch 001 production, or rye barrels in order to add structure and spice. This resulted in four combinations of source and barrel finish: Tennessee bourbon finished in rum casks, Tennessee bourbon finished in rye barrels, Indiana whiskey finished in rum casks, and Indiana whiskey finished in rye barrels. A number of barrels from these combinations were selected and blended to create Barrell Whiskey Batch 004, with the Indiana whiskey being the predominant component.","Fresh baked gingerbread cookies engage the senses, with sweet brown sugar, toasted orange peel, and big rye spice rounding things out. It’s assertive and appealing, suggesting a bold and exciting sip lies ahead.","Spicy rye and peppery seasoned oak build structure around sweet molasses and raw cane sugar. There’s a sweetness that’s reminiscent of Dr. Pepper or root beer, but it draws a balance with what is otherwise a more whiskey-forward base of flavors. This includes the more typical caramel, butterscotch, vanilla, and oak elements. The layers and depth of flavors are evident on the palate and really enjoyable, signalling the complex process of finishing and blending that was undertaken in order to bring this whiskey together.","Hands-down a pleasing finish, Dr. Pepper sweetness and candied citrus lead the charge. Burnt rye spice and black pepper add dimension. The big flavor lasts for a short amount of time, but leaves a lingering sweetness behind making for a medium-length finish that turns a bit dry towards the end.","When I last spoke with Joe Beatrice, the company’s founder, he was notably excited about this particular release. While each of his barrel finished whiskeys has been interesting, this one seems to take things to a new level.

Starting with a bourbon from Tennessee and a whiskey from Indiana, and then finishing in two different types of used spirits barrels for a combination of four different whiskeys to make up the blend sounds gimmicky, but turns out really intriguing. I can’t say with certainty something similar has never been done before, but I can say the complexity of this level of finishing and blending goes beyond the norm.

While the end result of experimentation can often be a letdown, Barrell Whiskey Batch 004 is anything but. Introducing a rum cask finished component is the most interesting aspect of this blend, but also the most risky. To draw a comparison, Angel’s Envy Finished Rye takes a base of 95% rye whiskey and lays a rum cask finish overtop. After up to 18 months of finishing, the rye characteristics are almost entirely eclipsed by rum sweetness. Not surprisingly, the ending result is a highly polarizing product.

Alternatively, Barrell’s process yields a much different end result and one I think will appeal to a wider audience of whiskey enthusiasts. Unlike Angel’s Envy, Whiskey Batch 004 draws a much better balance with rum sweetness, resulting in a flavor profile that builds off a base of whiskey with complimentary, albeit assertive, rum sweetness balanced against the structure of rye spice. The length of finishing time, inclusion of ex-rye barrel finished whiskeys in the blend, and the fact that the rum barrels used did not include any added sweeteners (as rums often do) are all factors in the equation leading to the end result. Regardless, the proof is in the pudding as evidenced by the whiskey’s flavor profile.","Barrell whiskeys are priced less than Barrell bourbons, providing evidence of the power of the “bourbon” classification in today’s marketplace. As each Barrell batch is a unique expression and released in reasonably limited quantities, availability is always a limited engagement. This particular batch of whiskey is a tremendous product that’s both unique and enjoyable, and as a result offers good value, even at its premium price point.",Barrell Whiskey Batch 004 shows how experimentation in whiskey finishing can lead to wonderfully delicious new things.,"Finished American whiskeys and bourbons are typically controversial among enthusiasts, as the finishing often results in something that just tastes different than what we’re used to. A good finished whiskey pushes the established boundaries of flavor, but doesn’t necessarily break the mold when it comes to building off the original product. When it comes to finishing, there is a fine line between success and failure that only seems visible once it’s been crossed. To me, success is a final product that pushes into a new space of flavors and manages to incorporate them in a pleasing way, which can range anywhere from a gentle introduction to a powerful embrace. Barrell Whiskey Batch 004 pushes into that space, offering a fantastically balanced whiskey with assertive, yet not overpowering, sweet rum characteristics balanced against flavorful rye spice. It won’t be for everyone, but for those interested in exploring this flavor space, Batch 004 elevates the bar to a new high.

In Depth Review,"Barrell Whiskey: Infinite Barrel Project - February 12, 2018 Release",Whiskey,Barrell Craft Spirits,Sourced from numerous undisclosed distilleries,May 2018,119.3,NAS,"Blend of many different types of whiskey, undisclosed percentages (Tennessee Whiskey and Rye, Indiana Whiskey finished in Oloroso Sherry butts, Indiana Rye, 100% Polish Malted Rye finished in Curacao barrels, Scotch Whiskey, and Irish Whiskey)",Light Gold,$70 (2018),,"The Infinite Barrel Project is a whiskey geek’s infinity bottle on a larger scale. According to Barrell Craft Spirits, “The intent is to create an ever-changing whiskey blended from barrels of mature whisk(e)y. We began by selecting barrels for their flavor contribution and complexity and blending them in a larger single, or ‘Infinite’ vessel. At each bottling, we’ll remove a portion of that whiskey and replace it with other barrels that will complement the remaining blend. We'll then repeat the process - bottling a portion and adding newly selected whiskeys each time.” 

Unlike a solera process, which strives for consistency over time and blends within a series of cascading barrels, the end goal of the Infinite Barrel Project is to create a unique whiskey with each release. With the Infinite Barrel Project, many whiskey barrels, or fractions of barrels, are combined into a single vessel. For a more detailed introduction to the Infinite Barrel Project, check out our previous article The Most Exciting Thing Happening in American Whiskey Right Now.



","Each time I pour a glass I seem to pick up different aromas - and each time the aromas seem to lead me down a slightly different path that becomes prominent for that specific pour. It’s almost as if the whiskey presents veins of unique scents and flavors that once identified become impossible to ignore, overshadowing the others that are present but more prominent at different times. In all cases the aromas are characteristically sweet, with gingerbread and hints of molasses and maple sugar candy. A grainy rye presents itself at times, and hints of malt are also present. There are traces of ethanol as well, but the intensity seems to vary each time. The scents are layered and complex but subtle at the same time.","Like the aromas on the nose, the palate seems to vary a bit each time I have a pour, sending me down uniquely different paths. Most notably it tastes characteristically like whiskey. Not bourbon, not scotch, not rye, not Irish whiskey...but rather the broad category of whiskey where just about anything goes. Like the nose, sweeter notes do seem to be most prominent, with hints of fruit, caramel, and creme brulee. I notice a good amount of seasoned oak at times, but it’s never characteristically woody. A trace of scotchy maltiness finds a presence as well, while at other times there seems to be a vein of rye spice that cannot be ignored. It’s well integrated, but does still taste like a mashup of sorts. Like Hillrock Solera Aged Bourbon, the integration and nuanced flavors are quite subtle and lie beneath the surface, requiring deeper exploration than usual to appreciate.","The finish seems to be the most consistent, where the flavors seem to normalize regardless of how they present themselves at times throughout the rest of the experience. Sweetness generally dominates at first, followed by a hint of maltiness along with a lingering rye spice against the sweeter notes. It’s a nice finish leaving me wanting to take another sip.","Needless to say, this concept is a unique one. While many of us have infinity bottles at home, I’ve yet to see a producer turn the concept into an ongoing release. Sure there have been collaborations and blends, but no one to my knowledge has attempted to integrate such a wide range of different whiskeys into an ever changing release.

When I asked the company’s founder Joe Beatrice what to expect out of this, he said to “expect the unexpected.” I didn’t know what it would taste like and the flavor profile, it turns out, is one I can’t quite seem to pin down. Like my own infinity bottle, this first release of Infinite Barrel Project Whiskey is a mashup of many different flavors. But unlike many evolutions of my own infinity bottle, the Infinite Barrel Project tastes good. What stands out the most about this first Infinite Barrel Project release is how the underlying nuanced scents and flavors seem to present themselves at different times. As any experienced whiskey drinker knows, a particular whiskey can taste a little different at different times given the time of day or what you might have had to eat or drink before it - not to mention that first pour from the bottle as compared with a later pour after it’s had a little time to air out. In this case, the extent of flavor variation from pour to pour and day to day was more pronounced than usual. It seems fair to attribute this to the fact that there are so many whiskeys in the blend, ultimately resulting in a more complex and layered whiskey than most. To that end, it’s been a fun whiskey to explore.



","The Infinite Barrel Project is going to be an ongoing release - each new dump will be denoted by the bottling date on the label with further details provided on the company’s website. Considering the volume for each release will likely be reasonably small, Barrell probably could have priced this at a premium relative to their standard Barrell Whiskey releases. But they didn’t. While it’s still released at a premium price point in the marketplace, $70 MSRP, it’s certainly not over the top. Considering this is the first release, the Infinite Barrel Project is a must-buy for Barrell fans who will undoubtedly want to compare it to future releases to experience the changes over time. For those not necessarily interested in the concept itself, at face value it’s still a one off unique tasting barrel proof whiskey.

","The inaugural release of the Infinite Barrel Project is intriguing - a good whiskey in its own right that also shows promise for what lies ahead.

","To say this first release of Infinite Barrel Project whiskey is a success would be accurate. Having discussed the project with Beatrice and master distiller Tripp Stimson prior to tasting it, I was both excited and apprehensive about what would be in store. Regardless, the concept intrigued me so much that it quickly became a focal point of mine. The integration of flavors in this release of Infinite Barrel Project is well executed, though it is still a mashup of many flavors as infinite blends tend to be and one that I feel could transform into something even better and more layered over time. It has me going back for more and I would say that my curiosity to discover something new each time I sip it, along with anticipation of future batches yet to come, is what drives my affinity for not only this release but for the concept as a whole.

,Barterhouse,Classification: Bourbon,Company: Diageo/Orphan Barrel Whiskey Distilling Co.,Distillery: Bernheim,Released: March 2014,Proof: 90.2,Age: 20 Years,"Mashbill: 86% Corn, 8% Malted Barley, 6% Rye",Color:  Amber,MSRP: $75 (2014),Official Website,"First and second release each consisted of about 45,000 bottles. Review bottle number: 25,224","Sweet and pleasant upon first whiff. Oak, cherries, creme brulee and vanilla dominate.  It’s a lethal combination for anyone with a sweet tooth. It’s not incredibly deep but very nice.","Dry oak hits first with caramel, cherry and vanilla following. Not as sweet tasting as the nose suggests and not as oaky as the age suggests. It doesn’t have a very complex palate, yet what it offers is very enjoyable.","Thin, smooth and short which partly has to do with the 90.2 proof point. Definitely on the sweeter side. Enjoyable but over too quickly.","There are two sides to this coin. The first is the background side. Diageo doesn’t operate a bourbon distillery. They source the bourbon for their Bulleit brand from Four Roses and the Bulleit Rye from MGP in Indiana. They also own the mothballed Stitzel-Weller distillery where they store barrels from many out-of-business bourbon distilleries. They have begun to tap into these stocks and are branding the bourbon that comes from them the Orphan Barrel Whiskey Project. Barterhouse is the first release in this new brand.

Even though there are in the range of 50,000 Barterhouse bottles in this first release, this is a very unique and rare release. There is a finite number of bottles Diageo can pull from and it’s only a matter of time before Barterhouse is gone forever.

The other side of the coin is the bourbon itself. Every bourbon on the market has something about it that makes it taste unique. It’s a bourbon’s finer points that make it memorable. Barterhouse is easy-drinking and very pleasant, it just doesn’t have enough to make you really remember it. You’ll enjoy your experience with it, but won’t feel the need to stockpile it.","On paper, $75 for a 20 year old bourbon is within the range of acceptability. Elijah Craig released a 21 year bourbon at the end of 2013 for $150. As part of their annual Antique Collection, Buffalo Trace released an 18 year old rye and a 19 year old bourbon for $70. The Parker Heritage’s 2013 release was a 10 year old bourbon that sold for around $100. As always though, age doesn’t mean a thing if the bourbon doesn’t taste good.

Barterhouse has a very pleasant taste but its low proof and watered down palate do the bourbon a disservice. You could probably say any bottle’s palate would be better served at an above 100 proof point. Marker’s Mark could be infinitely better at a higher proof point. “What ifs” are simply rhetoric. What you're reviewing is the bottle in hand. Did I feel drinking Barterhouse that I paid too much? Yes. Did I feel ripped off? No. The bourbon is just unique enough to put the value of Barterhouse in the acceptable range.","Hard to hate, but hard to fully love. There's enough being offered at a reasonable price to enjoy here.",Barterhouse is an above average tasting experience that you’ll probably enjoy your time with. For a 20 year old bourbon it has surprisingly very manageable levels of oak and a very playful amount of sweetness. It’s an interesting first release in Diageo’s Orphan Barrel brand that makes me curious what else they have in store.,Eric,4,3.5,3,3.5,3.5,3.5,https://www.breakingbourbon.com/review/barterhouse
,Blanton's Straight From the Barrel,Classification: Straight Bourbon,"Company: Sazerac Conapny Inc., Blanton's Distilling Company",Distillery: Buffalo Trace,Released: Ongoing,Proof: 130,Age: NAS,"Mashbill: Corn, Rye, Malted Barley - (Exact ratios not provided, however this uses the Buffalo Trace Mashbill #2 which is said to be 12-15% rye)",Color:  Dark Copper,MSRP: $110 (2017),Official Website,"This bourbon whiskey was dumped on 7-6-12 from Barrel No. 6. It was stored in Warehouse H on Rick No. 7. The registered Bottle No. is 53. The proof on the Straight from the Barrel edition varies by bottle depending on the barrel. The bourbon comes off the still at 140 proof and enters the barrel at 125 proof. This particular bottle being reviewed comes in at an even 130 proof. Straight from the Barrel edition is currently only offered in international markets and in some domestic duty free stores. Due to only being available in the international marketplace, fluctuation in price based on foreign currency exchange rates is normal.

This bourbon was bottled specially for sale in the U.K. and is only sold in 700ml bottles. It was purchased for £70 when the dollar was trading at $1 to £1.55.","Raisins, dried fruit, orange citrus zest, and lightly toasted oak all merge together in a perfect blend. I can best describe it as warming and inviting, like a toasty wood burning fire on a cold winter’s day. It’s just a perfect blend of everything you love about the nose on Blanton’s, just enriched and greatly amplified. Taking a big breath in the alcohol is definitely upfront and noticeable, as should be expected for a 130 proof bourbon. While the alcohol isn’t overpowering, it definitely makes itself present and takes away ever so slightly from the experience.","While the nose underplays the fact that this is 130 proof, the palate definitely brings you right back to reality. This is a big, bold, rich bourbon that’s packing some heat. Ever so dry, the palate brings through a rich, heavy dose of oak along with vanilla, light honey, butterscotch, and plump juicy raisins. You really are contending with the heat though to pick out these flavors. Adding a few drops of water helps slightly reduce the heat and really pulls out the flavors in the palate.","The finish starts just like the palate, which in a word is HOT. The moment I finish taking my sip, my mouth instantly explodes into a ball of fire as the alcohol takes over. Ironically that burn is really just contained to my mouth and doesn’t travel down my throat or into my stomach like some other barrel proof bourbons like George T. Stagg are known to do. The finish is definitely drier, however it carries with it a nice flavor profile of preserved peaches, light vanilla, raisins, and oak. Even adding a few drops of water does little to subdue this fiery beast. It’s a shame because the heat overpowers the flavors just a little too much in this case to really appreciate all this has to offer.","Barrel proof bourbons are more and more common in today’s marketplace, with many more new releases being barrel proof / cask strength than in years past. That being said, a single barrel, barrel proof bourbon is still the exception to the norm. Even rarer is a standard lower-proof single barrel being offered in addition to a barrel proof offering of the same brand. The only other company offering this combination is Four Roses with their standard single barrel and barrel proof private selection bottles and occasional limited releases.

Blanton’s Straight from the Barrel (SFTB) flavor profile is a tasty enhanced bolder Blanton’s, though the heat from the proof greatly impacts the overall experience by taking away from the palate and more so the finish. Additionally, I’m not blown away tasting anything so unique that you might find in a George T. Stagg or a William Larue Weller. That being said, it’s really interesting to see not only what Blanton’s tastes like at full strength, but also how great of a job Buffalo Trace does in taming this beast down to the standard Blanton’s Original Single Barrel that’s lower cost and more readily accessible in the U.S.

Blanton’s SFTB only being sold in select non-U.S. markets and select domestic duty free stores is a shame. This version of Blanton’s offers a unique chance to see what Blanton’s tastes like when it’s cranked up to full strength, and boy does it deliver on that promise. This bottle clocks in at 37 proof higher than the standard version of Blanton’s and even 27 proof higher than the very tasty Blanton’s Gold edition.","Since this is an international only bourbon, the price will be tied to foreign currency fluctuation for anyone looking to import or buy abroad. When I reviewed Blanton’s Gold, for example, it was selling at almost double the cost of two bottles of standard Blanton’s, whereas now it’s only one and a half times the amount. That being said, Blanton’s SFTB consistently sells for the same price one could snag two bottles of original Blanton’s for, with change left over. Not even taking into account the cost of acquiring through either travel or import fees, apples to apples it also sells for higher than the bottles in the Buffalo Trace Antique Collection (BTAC) which this can best be compared to.

While the price may be higher, it wins points on being much more available than the Buffalo Trace Antique Collection. Released throughout the year, you can usually find a bottle online in the foreign market if you look hard enough and are willing to pay import fees. Additionally, it comes back to being one of the few single barrel, barrel proof offerings on the market and one that delivers an experience that helps justify the higher price.","Big, bold, and definitely hot…why isn’t this a part of the Buffalo Trace Antique Collection yet?","As we’ve stated on the site in the past, in all actuality this could be a contender for the 6th addition to the Buffalo Trace Antique Collection, or at least an alternative for anyone having trouble locating BTAC. Its flavor profile is bold, it’s offered as a single barrel, barrel proof bourbon, and offers a unique drinking experience. It’s a shame that Buffalo Trace doesn’t offer this in its own domestic marketplace as many would snap this up as quick as they do the bottles in the Buffalo Trace Antique Collection. Granted the price would be a little higher than the bottles in the Antique Collection, it’s doubtful that would slow many down in today’s marketplace.

For me, Blanton’s SFTB isn’t quite as well balanced of a drinking experience as what Blanton’s Gold delivers. The heat slightly off balances the palate and finish, and when the price difference is taken into account, I’d personally rather have a bottle of Blanton’s Gold to enjoy with money left over in my pocket. That said, I know that this is a bourbon that is on many individual’s list to try, and I do highly suggest seeking it out to experience it. The heat in the palate and finish may run rampant and would be served better if it was tamed, but if you like Blanton’s, you’re in for a treat to experience it at barrel strength. Additionally, if you regularly miss out on the BTAC release each year, it’s a nice alternative that still delivers a great unique experience from Buffalo Trace.",Jordan,4.5,3.5,3,4,2.5,3.5,https://www.breakingbourbon.com/review/blantons-straight-from-the-barrel
,Booker's 25th Anniversary,Classification: Straight Bourbon,Company: Beam Suntory,Distillery: Jim Beam,Released: February 2014,Proof: 130.8,"Age: 10 Years, 3 Months","Mashbill: 77% Corn, 13% Rye, 10% Malted Barley",Color:  Dark Amber,MSRP: $100 (2014),Official Website,"(Barrel Proof, Batch #2014-01): Booker's 25th is a limited release celebrating the 25th anniversary of the commercial release of Booker's. Booker's was the mastermind of Fredrick Booker Noe II, who was Jim Beam’s grandson. Bookers served as the master distiller at Jim Beam from 1965 until 1992, where he then worked as an ambassador for the company until his death in 2004.

Initially Booker would hand select barrels to give as holiday gifts for friends. Eventually the popularity of these bottles caught on and Beam started bottling this en masse. Booker's was launched in 1988 as the first mass produced bourbon bottled straight-from-the-barrel, uncut and unfiltered. The bourbon normally ranges in proof between 121-130.6 and is aged 6-8 yrs. For the 25th Anniversary, the bourbon was barreled in January of 2003 and was extra aged, being pulled after aging 10+ years. Around 1,000 cases of 25th Anniversary were produced for this limited edition run.","Lots of alcohol upfront. Followed by toasted wood, light traces of nuts and coffee. While pleasant, I wasn’t blown away by the initial nose on this.","This bourbon was a big cup of sweet for me. A strong blast of the sugars from the wood hits you the moment you take a sip. Caramel and vanilla pop right out of this bourbon, along with a light woody taste. In addition to the sugar and wood, I also tasted a trace of citrus along the line of orange rinds. The palate quickly morphs into a nice long finish. For bourbon this high in proof, it’s a really easy to sip neat.","The flavors found in the finish hit quickly and stay consistent throughout. It’s comprised of a mellow nutty flavor along the lines of walnuts, with light traces of toasted marshmallow.","Barreled just before the death of Fred Noe II, the extra 4+ years in the aging warehouse treated this bourbon well. Much like the Booker's 10th anniversary release, Booker's 25th is a special one off release from the Beam Family. Once these bottles are gone, they’re gone for good…until the next commemorative anniversary bottling comes along.","At $100 you’re getting a really great tasting bourbon. The normal bottling of Booker's retails for a little under $60 and is really great tasting bourbon as is. However this special bottling ups the game ever so slightly. Is it worth the extra $40 to buy a bottle? That one is debatable. If you’re a fan of Booker's normally, you’ll definitely want to try to find any remaining bottles. If you’ve never had Booker's or aren’t a huge fan normally, stick to trying to find a glass of this one in your favorite bourbon bar.",A very suiting tribute to a legendary master distiller.,"I liked Booker's 25th a lot. It was a very easy sipper for such a high proof, and I had a really nice time sipping this bourbon. I do wish the nose was better on this bottle, but then again the nose on a normal Booker's bourbon isn’t anything to write home about either.

While my preference for this bourbon was to drink it neat, if you’re inclined to add a few drops of water, I’d say go right ahead. The nose didn’t change for me, but the bourbon morphed from a sweet sipper, to a spicy bold flavored bourbon full of pepper and wood. On the finish I picked up flavors of tobacco, bark, cherry syrup, and strangely enough very light traces of bubble gum. Really feels like you’re getting a two-for-one deal on this bourbon. Enjoy a few sweet sips, and then add a little water to get a totally different profile.",Jordan,2,4,3,4,2.5,3.5,https://www.breakingbourbon.com/review/bookers-25th-anniversary
,Breckenridge Bourbon,Classification: Bourbon,Company: Breckenridge,Distillery: Breckenridge Distillery,Released: Ongoing,Proof: 86,Age: Per the bottle - “Aged for a minimum of 2 years in charred new American oak barrels.” Per the company’s website - “The average age at bottling is 2-3 years.” Per an interview with Master Distiller Jordan Via - “After the first release it has always been at least 3 years old.”,"Mashbill: 56% Yellow Corn, 38% Green Rye, 6% Unmalted Barley",Color:  Fresh Steeped Tea,MSRP: $45 (2017),Official Website,"Master Distiller Jordan Via says the water the distillery uses is the key. It’s Breckenridge’s municipal water supply, which is essentially fresh snowmelt, and is said to be naturally rich in minerals. Breckenridge is located 9,600 feet above sea level nestled in Colorado’s Rocky Mountains.","Cinnamon, rye spice, oak, and vanilla with just the right amount of burn.","Rye spice, cinnamon, and pepper contrast with oak, vanilla, and honey. It’s a nice balance. It looks thin in the glass, however the flavor is fuller than would be expected considering the proof.","Medium length with just the right amount of burn. The flavors really taper off nicely and it leaves a wonderful aftertaste. It feels more like a 90+ proof sip than 86, which is a good thing in this case.","When it comes down to the sip, nothing screams unique with this bourbon. It’s no-gimmick, traditional, yet well rounded flavor is something you’d have difficulty picking out in a blind taste test. Their story is somewhat compelling, as the distillery claims to use mineral-rich snowmelt as it’s not-so-secret secret ingredient. And then there’s its young 2-3 year age which you’d never guess based on taste alone. Ultimately this is a premium quality, traditional *yet very good* tasting bourbon that can be produced more quickly than you’d expect.","Craft distillery bourbons span a wide range of quality, from amazingly unique gems down to corny, grassy, not-aged-quite-enough garbage. Some are like nothing you’ve ever tasted, while others fall short of anything you’d want to drink again. Unfortunately the quality is rarely reflected in price, as these smaller distilleries typically have to sell at a premium to make their nut. Often times we’re paying for the experience and story behind the bottle as much as the spirit inside it. $50 for a craft-distilled 750ml bottle is acceptable, regardless of the quality or age of the juice within the bottle. Breckenridge manages to pull of something miraculous giving us a smooth, well-rounded, easy sipper that’s worth the $43 they sell it for. It beats the pants off Rhetoric, which is more than double the price.",A great-tasting bourbon with widespread appeal that’s wise beyond its years.,"I almost wanted to hate this bourbon. For some reason, when I see a bourbon covered in awards I tend to think “gimmick.” As far as I’m concerned I don’t give a crap what awards it won at what spirits competition. Despite my personal opinion on this, their marketing has worked well because they’ve managed to move past their local barriers and break into the mainstream with widespread distribution. Furthermore, whatever marketing and behind-the-scenes growth magic is going on doesn’t change the fact that the widespread distribution is backed by a solid bourbon that has mass appeal. I wondered how a craft distillery in the little town of Breckenridge could be producing so much bourbon, and I think I stumbled onto an answer. According to discussions online, it’s been said that Breckenridge does some distillation onsite and then outsources the overflow to another distillery or distilleries. The ingredients are the same and the process is controlled by their specifications, of course. I’m also curious on how it’s being aged, if there are any additional factors at play here. I emailed the company about this but have yet to hear back on a reply. It’s all the same to me, but I’d really like to know more about how this wonderful bourbon is coming together in such a short time.

Breckenridge was kind enough to respond to my email inquiry - ""Yes, we are outsourcing a portion of the bourbon that ends up in the bottle. The other portion is mashed, fermented, distilled, aged, proofed, and blended in house. Once we get our new still in (prob in September) we'll be able to catch up with demand and transition to everything in the bottle being made in house. As for who we are partnering with for distillation, that is proprietary, sorry!"" I'm certainly looking forward to more to come from this distillery as we continue to watch them grow.",Nick,3,3.5,4,2.5,3,3.5,https://www.breakingbourbon.com/review/breckenridge-bourbon
,Charbay “Whiskey S” Hop Flavored Whiskey Lot S 211A,Classification: Whiskey,Company: Charbay Distillery,Distillery: Charbay Distillery,Release Date: Ongoing,Proof: 99,Age: NAS,Mashbill: Undisclosed,Color: Dark Gold,MSRP: $125 (2020),Official Website,"Charbay has been creating spirits, wines, ports, aperitifs, and liqueurs for 36 years in Northern California. According to the company, there isn’t another family in the U.S. that can “claim to hand-producing the scope of handcrafted wines & spirits than that of Charbay.” The company’s founder Milorad (Miles) Karakasevic traces their family’s winemaking and distillery experience to 1751 in the former Yugoslavia. After receiving formal training overseas, Karakasevic arrived in North America at age 21. In 2010, Karakasevic became the U.S.’s only Grand Master Distiller, which is to a distiller who has distilled all four of the major spirits categories: brandy, whiskey, rum, and tequila. His son, Marko, is now master distiller at Charbay after a 26 year classical European apprenticeship with his father. According to the company, in 2009, Marko formally became a master distiller using the classical definition: he was recognized as having “equaled or bettered the skill of his Teacher, his father.” Marko continues with the family tradition of pushing the creativity of the spirits and wine they craft.","A fascinating and pungent aroma of cocoa powder, fresh hops, rich malt, and coffee beans. There’s a lingering Guinness-like scent that’s rich with frothy maltiness that trails after the other notes dissipate. The contrast from fresh springy hops to deep-roasted stout is fascinating for its uniqueness.","A cornucopia of hop and malt flavors creates a complex and quite frankly, strange flavor profile overall. It leans heavily on chocolate malt, which brings a roasted characteristic into the mix. Being so hop and malt forward keeps the flavor profile rather tight, focusing on compatible flavors of leather, cocoa, deep molasses, roasted malt, and dark brown sugar. It’s well constructed and one of a kind.","Spiced chocolate and chocolate malt balls pop first before transitioning into a heavy leather, damp oak, and chocolate malt profile. As the leather and oak taper, it leaves a long lasting chocolate malt aftertaste that takes ages to dissipate.","Being one-of-a-kind is Charbay’s M.O. Utizialing double distillation, a 7-10 fraction separation process, pure red copper two plated pot stills that are heated with a live gas flame, and aging their whiskey in French oak barrels is the definition of unique. If that wasn’t enough, what they do with their equipment is where the real creativity blossoms.

The foundation of Charbay Whiskey S Hop Flavored Whiskey is built upon Bear Republic's Big Bear Stout. Being distilled from a bottle-ready 8.1% stout that contains five different malts along with Centennial and Cascade hops that is then aged in French oak for 22-29 months, this whiskey is a love letter to beer. It also begs the question who would even be crazy enough to think of such a whiskey, let alone follow through with its creation? The result is a whiskey that’s fascinating, well constructed, and at times even odd, but never boring.","It shouldn’t be a surprise that a whiskey this unique comes at a high cost. There isn’t anything about its creation that screams phone-in or mass produced. As an artisan whiskey, it costs more to produce and rightfully carries a higher price tag. It’s not always easy to find, so when you find a store that actually carries it, prices can fluctuate based on that store’s perceived rarity or specialness. If you do find it at its $125 MSRP, while expensive, still comes in around the same pricing as limited edition whiskeys from major distilleries. Of course taking the plunge, and in a way, gamble that you’ll hopefully like it, can be risky. The best way I can describe it: if you find a lot of scotches too exotic, Charbay Whiskey S Hop Flavored Whiskey might not be for you. But if you’re looking for a bottle to shock friends, or visit when you’re tired of the tried and true, Charbay has a whiskey for you.","Heavy on dark malts that are accented by fresh hops isn’t what many American whiskey drinkers are familiar with, and because of that, Charbay Whiskey S Hop Flavored Whiskey will likely challenge you on all fronts.","Charbay Whiskey S Hop Flavored Whiskey’s unique origin is also what will make it taste so foreign to most whiskey drinkers. This isn’t a variation of another whiskey you’ve had. This is its own beast, that will challenge you as a whiskey drinker. Therefore there will be plenty of whiskey drinkers that don’t connect with it. This will probably come to the surprise of no one at Charbay, as this is what they’ve built their reputation on. They push whiskey norms and buck drinkers’ expectations with whiskeys that demand contemplation. This isn’t an everyday sipper, but one that will take you down a different path when you’re ready to take it.",Eric,3.5,3.5,3.5,5,2.5,3.5,https://www.breakingbourbon.com/review/charbay-whiskey-s-hop-flavored-whiskey-lot-s-211a
,Chattanooga Whiskey 111 Cask,Classification: Straight Bourbon,Company: Chattanooga Whiskey Co.,Distillery: Chattanooga Riverfront Distillery,Release Date: Ongoing,Proof: 111,Age: 2 Years,"Mashbill: 75% Yellow Corn, 25% Malt (Malted Rye, Caramel Malted Barley & Honey Malted Barley - exact percentages not disclosed)",Color: Medium Copper,Price: $45 (2019),Official Website,"Chattanooga Whiskey 111 Cask is the unfiltered, barrel strength expression of Chattanooga Whiskey’s signature high malt bourbon, Chattanooga Whiskey 91. Unlike 91 however, Cask 111 is not Solera aged. It’s made from a single fermentation which is extended 7 days. Each 8-12 barrel batch represents a single distillation run. It’s aged for at least two years in toasted and charred 53 gallon barrels before bottling.

The bottle in review is from batch 19G19R.","Toffee, caramel, and butterscotch meet dark fruit and raisins in this bouquet of scents. It has a malty, almost nutty undertone that softens the delivery and helps keep the individual aromas in check, allowing each to come through without overpowering any others. A whisper of ethanol is also present, but less than expected considering the proof. Overall it's a bit unusual at first, but grows on you after you get to know it.","Rich and full-bodied. The whiskey is characteristically sweet, with raisins, caramel chews, butterscotch, and honey combining to form a base of flavors that combine with an undeniable presence of malt. It has a creamy mouthfeel, and joined with a dash of baking spices delivers a fantastic experience on the palate.",A quick burst of allspice fused with nutmeg is quickly overcome by sweeter butterscotch and toffee. A light pepper lingers on the backend. Medium in length but enjoyable nonetheless.,"Chattanooga claims a high malt percentage in the mashbill, using three different malted grains. I was successful in confirming it's made of 75% yellow corn and 25% malt, but Chattanooga Whiskey holds the three malted grains breakdown percentages close to the chest. It's unusual not to see rye or wheat as the secondary flavoring gain, and those familiar with the growing category of American malt whiskeys know just how good they can be.

Here, the combination of three different malts combined with the sweetness from the corn yields a very pleasing result. Being bottled at 111 proof allows the richness of flavors to come through, and the absence of filtering allows for a full-bodied mouthfeel that’s everything you could want in a whiskey. While it’s only two years old, you would never guess that based on the flavor profile alone, which speaks to the quality of distillation taking place at Chattanooga Whiskey's Riverfront Distillery.

Most importantly though, the flavor profile stands on its own. It’s unlike other bourbons on the shelves, and notably not just different with its sweet but malty and rich flavor profile, it's strikingly good.","While Chattanooga Whiskey 111 Cask is only two years old, it is important to remember it was distilled by Chattanooga Whiskey who had been sourcing whiskey for eight years and only recently started distilling in 2015. In fact, if you take away the age statement you would be hard-pressed to guess its age compared to what many other young distilleries are putting out at two years old. Chattanooga Whiskey delivers on a whole different level. Combine this with its higher 111 proof and unique flavor profile, and it’s an easy buy recommendation at $45.",Chattanooga Whiskey 111 Cask delivers a full-bodied unique pour that’s unlike most bourbons out there.,"Chattanooga Whiskey has my attention. 111 Cask showcases just how well Chattanooga Whiskey is distilling, and at only two years old, it's not just to the point where I can see the potential, the proof is already in the bottle...no pun intended. Would aging longer make it taste different? Absolutely. Better? Maybe. The point is, the bourbon is really good as-is and succeeds at delivering a different, yet really enjoyable drinking experience. Chattanooga Whiskey 111 Cask is definitely one to pick up.",Nick,3.5,3.5,3,3.5,3,3.5,https://www.breakingbourbon.com/review/chattanooga-whiskey-111-cask
,Cream of Kentucky Bourbon,Classification: Straight Bourbon,Company: J.W. Rutledge Distillery,Distillery: From an undisclosed Kentucky distillery,Release Date: January 2019,Proof: 102,Age: 11.5 Years,Mashbill: Undisclosed,Color: Chestnut,MSRP: $150,Official Website,"The Cream of Kentucky brand was originally introduced in 1888 by I. Trager & Co. of Cincinnati, Ohio. The brand became popular in the 30’s and 40's, thanks in part to Norman Rockwell providing artwork for its marketing. Jim Rutledge now owns the brand and chose to use it as his first release from his new distillery, J.W. Rutledge Distillery.

Rutledge was the master distiller at Four Roses for 21 years. He left the company in 2015 and not long after announced he was creating his own distillery with plans to break ground for construction of the new distillery in 2019.

Rutledge is targeting a 9,000 bottle release of Cream of Kentucky every three months for a total of 36,000 bottles in 2019. It is currently available in CA, CO, KY, IL, IN, MA, MD, and Washington, D.C.","A warm and inviting aroma greets you as a bouquet of fruit notes is overwhelming. As it sits, notes of cherry cold medicine, cola, and heavy oak develop and become more pronounced. Its balance of sweet and oak is very satisfying, and its twinge of heat and additional sweetness are welcomed.","Sweet fruit flavors are proudly on display and are reinforced by additional notes of caramel, vanilla, and milk chocolate. This is nicely balanced against a hearty oak and nut element. Overall a decent amount of complexity and mingling of flavors makes this an interesting palate and one that’s quite fun to drink.","Bitter notes are prominent right out of the gate, followed by heavy oak and walnut, capped off with a flare of heat. By far the weakest and most flawed part of the sip. Despite this setback, it helps counter the strong sweetness of the palate in an agreeable way. The bitterness does become less impactful with subsequent sips, just not enough to completely forget about it.  ","The first release from Jim Rutledge’s new distillery is noteworthy. He was instrumental in Four Roses’ growth over the past two decades and it will be fascinating to see the direction he takes his own distillery in. Cream of Kentucky unfortunately isn’t his own distillate, instead sourced distillate handpicked by Rutledge himself. This perhaps gives us a peek into the direction he may take his own distillate when it comes of age.  

Rutledge’s version Cream of Kentucky is an interesting one though. It’s far from straightforward and features a good amount of complexity, while still maintaining a good degree of flavor balance. It’s quite sweet and fruity which is similar to a Four Roses bourbon, but also offers heavy nut, oak, and bitter notes that aren’t typically found in their bourbon. The result is a bourbon that marries what we love from Rutledge’s product in the past, yet still pushes forward into new territory.","Cream of Kentucky clocks in at $150, planting it in the realm of limited release pricing. It’s not necessarily marketed as a limited edition bourbon, yet with a target of 36,000 bottles set to release in 2019, the numbers speak for themselves. Limited, but not that limited.

Bourbon with age statements tend to command a higher price nowadays, especially ones in and around the 12 year mark. Barton 1792 just released a 12 year old 1792 for $50. Elijah Craig Barrel Proof still sports its 12 year age statement and asks $60. And then there’s something like the limited release of Evan Williams 12 Year for $130. So it’s clear not all age statements are created equal. Comparing Cream of Kentucky to 1792 12 Year for instance, there is a clear distinction of quality difference and one can understand the price disparity. Yet, Cream of Kentucky, despite its many positive traits, still suffers from a flawed finish and that’s where the its price becomes an issue. It’s within the realm of what the market will more or less accept, but those cracking these bottles to drink will most likely feel they paid too much for what they got.","A sweet, fruity and nut forward bourbon that’s both complex and unique, offset by a questionable finish and price.","Jim Rutledge comes out swinging with his first release from his newly minted distillery. Despite its sourced origins, it showcases what many loved about his flavor profile choices at Four Roses, but also ventures into new unproven territory for the master distiller. While the bourbon’s bitter notes in the finish might be damning for some, it surprisingly gets better in subsequent sips. That surely doesn’t excuse it, but it at least can help make its $150 price tag a bit more agreeable. You may not immediately fall in love with this bourbon, but this is a case where spending time with it reveals it virtues and discover its sum is greater than its parts. Rutledge is one of bourbon’s all-star veterans and it will be interesting to see what comes next from him and his new distillery.",Eric,3.5,3.5,2.5,3.5,2,3.5,https://www.breakingbourbon.com/review/cream-of-kentucky-bourbon
In Depth Review,E.H. Taylor Four Grain,Classification: Straight Bourbon,Company: Sazerac Company Inc.,Distillery: Buffalo Trace,Released: April 2017,Proof: 100,Age: NAS (Press release states 12 Years),Mashbill: Undisclosed,Color:  Rose Gold,MSRP: $70 (2017),Official Website,"E.H. Taylor Four Grain is made from a “distinct bourbon recipe” using corn, rye, wheat, and malted barley. It was distilled in 2005 and entered into the barrel at 104 proof. According to Buffalo Trace, these are the four grains E.H.Taylor would have had access to in the late 1800s, and why they were ultimately chosen for this release. In the company’s press release, master distiller Harlen Wheatley states, “We wanted to extract everything we like from both the rye and the wheat mashbills we currently use and combine them to see how they react. Not surprisingly, it added complexity to the finished product.”

E.H. Taylor Four Grain is a Bottled-in-Bond (BiB) bourbon. To be labelled BiB, the whiskey must be the product of one distillation season and one distiller at a single distillery, aged in a federally bonded warehouse under U.S. government supervision for at least four years, and it must be bottled at exactly 100 proof. Additionally, the BiB label must clearly identify the distillery where it was distilled and where it was bottled, if different.","A light but controlling floral and fruity overtone provides the base for the aromas. Hints of sweet berry, bubblegum, and vanilla lay over the elegant floral base. Very unintrusive notes of rye and oak are present, but barely make in impact. Overall very agreeable and pleasant, but hardly complex.","Flavors lean heavily on the sweet side, but are well composed. Strawberry, cherry, caramel, and vanilla are all bundled together providing the backbone of the flavor profile. They may border on too sweet for some, but perfect for others. Most noteworthy is that they’re quite gentle and soft in intensity, striking the perfect chord of refinement and approachableness.","Oak and rye spice make an appearance in the finish, and like the rest of the sip, are well disciplined. They don’t shout their arrival, but gently introduce themselves and quickly say goodbye. They provide a nice contrast to the sweeter side of the sip, and add a small bit of complexity that the bourbon is missing. The slightest trace of heat also pops during the finish, but overall this drinks on the lighter side for a 100 proof bourbon.","In the current climate of “gimmick bourbons,” a mashbill consisting of four grains is hardly new. Woodford Reserve released one in 2006 as part of their Master’s Collection. More recently, many craft producers have been experimenting with the idea. But because of limited distribution and marketing reach, most whiskey drinkers probably haven't had the opportunity to try them. What sets E.H. Taylor Four Grain apart from its craft counterparts is Buffalo Trace’s distilling expertise and the relatively high age of this product. In what could have been a muddled mess of flavors, Buffalo Trace managed to do the opposite. This release is actually quite disciplined with its flavors. Despite its lack of complexity, Buffalo Trace’s new mashbill shows quite a bit of maturity and uniqueness for being a first time release.","With many limited releases hitting the market north of $100, Buffalo Trace continues to buck this pricing trend. It’s certainly a praiseworthy decision, but the current reality of limited release numbers counters any goodwill the company was hoping to gain by the move. Taken as is, E.H. Taylor Four Grain is an excellent example of what a limited edition bourbon should cost and taste in 2017. The problem is few will have the opportunity to purchase it at its MSRP, but through and through, this is a solid bourbon for its MSRP. Comparably to other recent Taylor special releases, I would be willing to pay more for 2015’s Cured Oak, but less for 2016’s Seasoned Wood. With E.H. Taylor’s other whiskeys (Single Barrel, Rye, and Barrel Proof) all costing in the same ballpark as Four Grain, it probably proves that this is priced on the low side for a limited and unique release. That said, it could probably sit comfortably in the $100-$125 range, but for what it is, it easily warrants a $75-$100 price range.","This new mashbill from Buffalo Trace is a sweet and gentle affair, but what it lacks in complexity, it makes up for in enjoyability.","With the lack of a benchmark and proven track record pertaining to four grain mashbills, it’s still a bit of the wild west for this particular playing field. What is an amazing four grain (or in particular these four grains) bourbon supposed to strive for? Should it highlight the best elements of each of the grains? Or should it strive for an interesting interplay between all of the different grains? Should a deep, complex flavor profile be the highlight? Is it too much to ask for all of the above?

The answer might not be known until more hit the market and producers learn from each release. E.H. Taylor Four Grain certainly gets a lot right, but still has room to improve. Its sweet and gentle flavors make it a joy to drink. Its intensity is pitch-perfect. But there’s little trace of typical rye grain flavor characteristics, which hurts this bourbon. Because it’s so one-sided with sweet notes, its palate isn’t as complex as one would hope from a four grain mashbill. It’s also surprising being 12 years old, its age doesn’t leave more of a lasting impact on its flavor profile.

With all of that being said, this is an admirable first edition of what I hope is the first of many more to come. Buffalo Trace is definitely onto something here. I hope they have more resting in barrels and are able to learn and evolve each release and turn it into an annual release. For now, this is an interesting release that’s worth its asking price, and proves its worth taking a risk on something that’s unproven.

Taylor Barrel Proof Bourbon is made with Buffalo Trace’s Mashbill #1 that uses 10% or less rye as its secondary grain. This is the same mashbill that a number of the company’s bourbons use, most notably, Buffalo Trace Bourbon, Stagg Jr., and George T. Stagg. Although it doesn’t feature an age statement, it is said to be about the same age as Buffalo Trace Bourbon. Stagg Jr. is believed to be in the range of 8-10 years and George T. Stagg is 12+ years old.","A potent scent of buttered pecans strikes before layers of dark brown sugar, deep tobacco, and thick oak sidle in. The bourbon’s proof is quite evident as it presents a nose-tingling intensity. Slight hints of dark raspberry and apple interject, but are overtaken by an overwhelming amount of toasted nut scent. Overall it’s a rustic aroma that’s all-around quite pleasing.","You’re greeted with a very hot and grounded flavor profile thanks to its surprisingly soft sweet brown sugar and dark fruit notes. Vanilla bean, heavy oak, and burnt caramel further combine to create a familiar and straightforward flavor profile. It’s hot through and through, which is further amplified thanks to the bourbon’s shortfall of sweet flavors. Lacking a certain amount of wow factor, the bourbon makes up for it with a solid delivery of flavors that work very well together and simply hit the spot.","The bourbon’s hotness brings forth a minty menthol, coffee bean, and cinnamon nut aftertaste. Long lasting and rather vigorous at times, E.H. Taylor Barrel Proof doesn’t back down. Being so forceful at times, the flavors do make a striking impact. Like the palate, they aren’t overly complex, going for impact over sophistication. A decent amount of oak introduces a slightly dry element to the finish that isn’t detrimental and further adds to the grounded nature of the bourbon.","In recent years, Buffalo Trace has used their E.H. Taylor brand to launch a number of annual wholly original and unique whiskeys. Before this renewed attention, the Taylor brand wasn’t viewed as being overly exciting except for the fact it came in a tube. Yet the brand consistency hit a certain quality mark that became well revered among whiskey enthusiasts.

E.H. Taylor Barrel Proof has never reached the same mainstream fever pitch as George T. Stagg. Some of this is due to its exclusion from the Buffalo Trace Antique Collection (BTAC), but some of it is also probably due to its younger age, less bombastic flavor profile, and overall low-key annual releases. Never truly easy to find, but also never truly as hard as a BTAC release either, Taylor Barrel Proof has quietly chugged along.

Taylor Barrel Proof's ongoing good graces with whiskey drinkers has a lot to do with its constant quality. You’d be hard-pressed to call out any of its batches as being complete misses, and this is likely because it doesn’t swing for the fences. It most likely acts as an endpoint for some of the company’s better barrels that were destined for Buffalo Trace Bourbon batches at around the 6-7 year mark. They probably weren’t showing signs of a typical Stagg flavor profile and in turn, were earmarked for Taylor releases. Of course there is nothing wrong with that because just as not every movie needs to be a summer blockbuster, not every bourbon needs to be a Stagg either. Sometimes a subdued or familiar experience may not be as thrilling, but can still be quite satisfying.","E.H. Taylor Barrel Proof lands right in between the price points of Stagg Jr. ($60) and George T. Stagg ($100). Although both E.H. Taylor Barrel Proof and Stagg Jr. don’t feature an age statement, it is generally known that Stagg Jr. is older, which makes its pricing seem low compared to Taylor Barrel Proof. This was probably because Buffalo Trace wanted to have a larger price differentiator between Stagg’s junior and senior releases. The company has also marketed the entire Taylor portfolio as a more premium brand and priced and packaged them accordingly. Of course, being a Buffalo Trace product with limited availability has driven up both demand and prices almost universally. It only takes a quick internet search to see what online stores are charging for a given E.H. Taylor Barrel Proof release, which isn’t true to the same degree of the company’s other barrel proof products. Yet, if you can find it at MSRP - which hasn’t changed in years - it falls within the $60-$100 range many barrel proof bourbons are typically found in, and is the right price for this bourbon.",A non-flashy barrel proof bourbon in flashy packaging offers an overall solid and consistent quality pour.,"E.H. Taylor Barrel Proof never has received the rabid fanfare that George T. Stagg has received despite its consistent quality and overall difficulty of obtaining that seems to only increase demand for products. It often lacks a certain wow factor compared to recent George T. Stagg releases and even some Stagg Jr. batches. With its overall quality consistently hitting high marks, there’s little fear you’re purchasing a dud batch. In a way, E.H. Taylor Barrel Proof finds itself in a sort of Goldilocks zone between Buffalo Trace’s Stagg releases. It doesn't go out of its way to charm you with overly sweet or spicy flavors like those releases, and instead remains a relatively grounded sip. It’s a classic-tasting bourbon through and through that punctuates its sip with a sky high proof. E.H. Taylor Barrel Proof is rarely an exciting sip, but one that is staunt, constant, and confident in what it delivers.",Eric,3.5,3.5,3.5,3,2.5,3.5,https://www.breakingbourbon.com/review/e-h-taylor-jr-barrel-proof-bourbon-130-3-proof-batch-9

Taylor, Jr. Single Barrel",Classification: Straight Bourbon,"Company: Sazerac Company, Inc.",Distillery: Buffalo Trace,Release Date: Ongoing,Proof: 100,Age: NAS,"Mashbill: Undisclosed (Buffalo Trace's Mashbill #1, believed to be 10% rye or less)",Color: Copper,MSRP: $60,Website,"E.H. Taylor, Jr. Single Barrel is part of the E.H. Taylor, Jr. line, which also includes Small Batch, Barrel Proof, and Rye variants released throughout the year, along with limited one-off releases. With the exception of their Barrel Proof bourbon, all E.H. Taylor whiskeys are Bottled in Bond (BiB). To be labelled BiB, the whiskey must be the product of one distillation season and one distiller at a single distillery, aged in a federally bonded warehouse under U.S. government supervision for at least four years, and it must be bottled at exactly 100 proof. Additionally, the BiB label must clearly identify the distillery where it was distilled and where it was bottled, if different.","Classic scents greet the nose. Oak infused creamy vanilla is most prominent. Joining in are wafts of oatmeal, creamed corn, bubble gum, and fresh summer flowers. There is also the slightest touch of ethanol, which thankfully is less of a distraction and more of a reminder that this is a 100 proof bourbon. The vanilla scents are the highlight of the nose and are both delicate and prominent all at once. They make for a lovely way to open the sip.","This single barrel provides a palate that rewards you for taking your time and really exploring the sip. The vanilla carries over to the palate, however it isn’t the main focus. Instead a multitude of flavors develop alongside, including raisins, brown sugar, butterscotch, rye spice, dried oak, and leather. Its breadth and depth are a delight to explore, and when you add in its creamy mouthfeel, the palate is clearly the star of the sip.","The finish is full of drier flavors, which includes tobacco, leather, oak, and rye spice. A light dollop of butterscotch helps to temper the dryness. Oak and white pepper linger for an incredibly long time, giving the finish a welcomed staying power that ends on a high note.","While bottled in bond bourbons are easy to find, single barrel variants are more rare. Current widely distributed ongoing releases include E.H. Taylor, Jr Single Barrel and Henry McKenna Single Barrel. Both share the bottled in bond designation, but Henry McKenna carries a 10 year age statement along with the barrel number that it originated from. This is a main difference and differentiator between the two, as I’ve found some great Henry McKenna Single Barrels and some just satisfactory ones. Whereas with E.H. Taylor, Jr. Single Barrels, I’ve found more consistency from bottle to bottle, which may also be why Buffalo Trace chooses not to distinguish what barrel a bottle comes from or apply an age statement which would allow them to select more specifically by taste.

Being uncommon doesn’t automatically translate to a successful product, yet in this case it does turn out that way. The single barrel variant of the E.H. Taylor line seems to fill in the gaps that I find its small batch sibling to have. Whereas I find Small Batch to be lacking in complexity in the palate and longevity in the finish, the Single Barrel makes up for these shortcomings. It’s a bourbon that delivers a more refined sip overall and really highlights the capabilities of Buffalo Trace’s Mashbill #1.","Coming in at $60, E.H. Taylor, Jr. Single Barrel is priced right in the middle of the three ongoing release E.H. Taylor bourbons. There’s no beating around the bush when it comes to this line, $60 is a great price for this bourbon. It may not be age stated or a high proof burner, however for the money, you’re getting a bottled in bond bourbon that delivers big on flavor and complexity, resulting in truly an enjoyable sip. While you may pay less for Small Batch, which I find to be above average, Single Barrel elevates the line's game overall, and delivers a sip that other bottled in bond bourbons should strive to match.","A well-rounded bourbon at a very fair price, E.H. Taylor, Jr. Single Barrel is an example of what other bottled in bond bourbons should strive to be.","E.H. Taylor, Jr. Single Barrel is a gem in the E.H. Taylor family. It fills in the shortcomings of Small Batch nicely, which results in a sip that is full of flavor and complexity. It may not be a high proofer, but instead uses every bit of its 100 proof to pull out just the right amount of intensity of flavors in its sip. If you’re a fan of Buffalo Trace’s Mashbill #1, a fan or the E.H. Taylor series, or just a lover of bottled in bond bourbons in general, do yourself a favor and seek out a bottle of E.H. Taylor, Jr. Single Barrel. It’s not the best bourbon ever produced, but it is a really great example of what a bottled in bond single barrel bourbon is capable of becoming.",Jordan,3.5,4,3,3,3.5,3.5,https://www.breakingbourbon.com/review/e-h-taylor-jr-single-barrel
,Eagle Rare 17 Year 2014 Release,Classification: Straight Bourbon,Company: Sazerac Company Inc.,Distillery: Buffalo Trace,Released: Fall 2014,Proof: 90,Age: 19 Years,Mashbill: Undisclosed,Color:  Dark Amber,MSRP: $80 (2014),Official Website,"The 2014 expression was bottled from 26 barrels that saw a 54.9% loss to evaporation, totaling by our estimate only 4,531 bottles released this year. Despite the label stating “17 Years,” this year’s release was actually aged for 19 years. Buffalo Trace forgos having to re-register a new label each year and instead uses the same one as long as the age increases and not decreases from the stated “17 Years.”"," It’s a very bright and welcoming nose that is sweet and floral with notes of cherry, orange peel, and pine. There are decent amounts of oak and char under it all, but never does it seem like too much.","This is where the age of the bourbon really comes into play. It’s heavy on the oak and spice, to the point where it almost overpowers the other flavors. Cinnamon, brown sugar, and leather stick out the most with fainter hints of dark cherry and chocolate underneath.","The spice notes of the palate carry over to the finish. Allspice, nutmeg, and clove flavors develop on the finish while the sweeter elements of the palate completely retreat. The bourbon has a very thin, silky-smooth mouthfeel with little burn.","Last year’s Eagle Rare 17 Year was a great example of a balanced bourbon. Despite it being in the barrel for 19 years as well, it was a well rounded package of fruity flavors with the perfect amount of oak influence. This year’s edition, however, was affected by its time in the barrel much more than last year. I’ve been disappointed with almost every high aged bourbon I tasted in 2014. The common theme between them was the oak flavor overshadowed everything else about the bourbon. This is partly true of 2014’s Eagle Rare 17 Year. Oak is present in every aspect of this bourbon yet this is still one of the better recent examples of a high aged bourbon that didn't lose all of its characteristics after resting in the barrel for too long. That makes it unique to some degree but much less so compared to previous years.","It seems like every year Eagle Rare 17 Year and Thomas H. Handy are the two bottles in the Buffalo Trace Antique Collection that are the least regarded and sought after in the collection. This is mainly because they both hold high company with George T. Stagg, William Larue Weller, and Sazerac 18 Year. Where those bottles are generally thought to be worth more than their MSRP, Eagle Rare doesn’t hold that same esteem. With this year’s bottle being less balanced with its heavier oak influence, is it still worth it’s asking price?

Normally Eagle Rare 17 Year is worth every bit of its MSRP. This year I’m not sure I can say that. With a $10 increase over previous years, $80 for a decent 90 proof bourbon is asking a lot. Barterhouse (20 yrs), which is on the sweeter side compared to Eagle Rare 17 Year, was priced at $75 and Wild Turkey Diamond Anniversary (blend of 13 & 16 yrs), on the oakier side, was priced at $125, so Eagle Rare’s asking price is within the market’s range. This was definitely a year I felt the value and quality of Eagle Rare didn’t quite match previous years, although it’s still a fair asking price, because overall, it’s still a well-above-average bourbon.","A great bourbon, but its heavy oak notes almost derail the entire experience.","The 2014 Eagle Rare 17 Year is definitely teetering on the edge of too much time in the barrel. Despite being the same age as last year’s edition, the amount of oak influence is night and day. Some may say the 2014 edition is past its prime while others, like myself, say it’s right on the edge. The main thing Eagle Rare 17 Year always has going for it is its solid base it’s built on. Its fruity flavors and silky-smoothness helps it withstand the shockwaves of oak that this year’s edition has ripping through it. Hopefully next year this brand can return to what it has been known for: A top notch balanced bourbon.",Eric,3,3.5,3.5,3,3,3.5,https://www.breakingbourbon.com/review/eagle-rare-17-year-2014-release
In Depth Review,Four Roses 2019 Limited Edition Small Batch,Straight Bourbon,Kirin Brewery Company,Four Roses,September 2019,112.6,"Blend of 11, 15, and 21 year old bourbons","Blend of 75% Corn, 20% Rye, 5% Malted Barley and 60% Corn, 35% Rye, 5% Malted Barley",Bronze,$140 (2019),,"The 2019 Four Roses Limited Edition Small Batch consists of a blend of double digit aged bourbons. This includes a 21 year OBSV, 15 year OESK, 15 year OESV, and an 11 year OESV. This marks the first time that a limited edition Four Roses has featured a 21 year old bourbon. Four Roses uses 2 different mashbills and 5 different yeast strains to create 10 unique bourbon recipes. Of those recipes, 3 are blended together to make Limited Edition Small Batch 2019 - OBSV, OESK, and OESV. By comparison Four Roses Small Batch  uses 4 of the 10 recipes - OBSO, OBSK, OESO and OESK. Four Roses Bourbon uses up to all 10 recipes. The first letter is always O and designates the production facility, Four Roses Distillery. The second letter designates the mashbill which can be E (75% corn, 20% rye, 5% malted barley) or B (60% corn, 35% rye, 5% malted barley). The third letter is always S and designates the whiskey distillation, straight whiskey. The fourth letter designates the yeast strain, which can be V (delicate fruit), K (slight spice), O (rich fruit), Q (floral essence), or F (herbal notes).


","The nose isn’t as punchy as you’d expect for a higher proofed Four Roses bourbon. Nuanced scents of aged oak, preserved red fruits, and cinnamon, mingle with a light floral and pine needle undertone. The higher proof doesn’t impact the experience at all, as no hints of ethanol are present. It’s slightly more distinguished from a pour of standard Four Roses Small Batch, but just barely.","A big burst of canned peaches and syrup with a dollop of cream, fresh custard, rye spice, vanilla, and honey. The palate is incredibly sweet with loads of depth. The flavors unfold with complex elegance the more you roll the whiskey around in your mouth. Doing so also allows you to appreciate how much of an overall creamy-rich mouthfeel the sip delivers.","The sip ends with a warm finish. It starts with vanilla, pie crust, rye spice, red hot candy, and a touch of oak. These flavors transition to a cinnamon and leather mix that lingers before finishing on a note of aged oak. An overall pleasant way to end the sip.","Four Roses always delivers a unique combination of recipes and ages when it comes to their Limited Edition Small Batch releases, and this year’s release is no exception. Featuring for the first time ever a 21 year-old bourbon in one of their releases helps distinguish this year’s release from years past. Its flavorful and rich palate helps to drive that point home. In comparing it against a pour of standard Four Roses Small Batch, this year’s Limited Edition Small Batch is head and shoulders better. Since the introduction of Small Batch Select, the gap between a standard release and a Four Roses limited release product is smaller than ever.  While this year's limited edition is slightly sweeter on the palate with a little more muted spice and more defined oak in the finish, it doesn’t quite shine as bright as you’d expect it too comparably. This isn’t necessarily a knock against this year's Limited Edition Small Batch however, as it just goes to show you how impressive Small Batch Select is, and the high bar master distiller Brent Elliott now has to reach for his limited edition releases to overcome going forward.

","Four Roses has consistently been a champion of the consumer when it comes to pricing. The company’s great Small Batch can often be had for under $30, their equally impressive Single Barrel for under $50, and the new Small Batch Select for $55. That’s why the jump up to $140 for the Limited Edition Small Batch always feels like a shocker. In its defense, Limited Edition Small Batch usually contains a unique blend of recipes and ages not found in their other products. While this especially holds true for this year’s edition with the inclusion of a 21 year old bourbon into the blend, as a side effect of the introduction of Small Batch Select, it’s harder to justify Limited Edition Small Batch's massive price difference as being anything above average. Yes, this year’s blend still uses high aged bourbons and a combination of three recipes, however those same three recipes comprise three out of the four recipes found in Small Batch Select. While the ages of the bourbon used are almost double or triple that of Small Batch Select’s blend, the sip offered isn’t as big of an increase comparably. Many should take solace in the fact that they can get a pretty close drinking experience by finding a bottle of Small Batch Select for less than half the price.

","Four Roses releases another complex and expertly blended Limited Edition Small Batch, but its price is hard to justify thanks to the company's introduction of Small Batch Select to their portfolio.","This year’s Limited Edition Small Batch Select is an interesting release. The palate is one of the better ones that you’ll find in 2019 and is easily the standout highlight of the sip. This combined with the age and complexity of the blend, delivers a product that helps ease the blow of the high price tag and will please all those who get to experience a pour. However, 2019 also saw Four Roses release Small Batch Select, a product, while not as refined as this year’s Limited Edition Small Batch, is so drinkable and managed to reset the bar of what it means to be a great ongoing release by Four Roses. With this new benchmark in place to compare against, 2019’s Limited Edition Small Batch delivers a great pour, but one that’s not as impactful as past years have often delivered. It’s still one worth seeking out if you’re a Four Roses fan, however the blow of not finding one can be easily lessened thanks to the recent addition of Small Batch Select to the Four Roses family.

,Four Roses Single Barrel,Classification: Straight Bourbon,Company: Kirin Brewery Company,Distillery: Four Roses,Released: Ongoing,Proof: 100,Age: NAS,"Mashbill: 60% Corn, 35% Rye, 5% Malted Barley",Color:  Amber,MSRP: $40 (2017),Official Website,"Four Roses uses 2 different mashbills and 5 different yeast strains to create 10 unique bourbon recipes. Their standard 100 proof single barrel is always OBSV, and consequently if it is a Four Roses Single Barrel and 100 proof then it must be OBSV (for example their Secretariat Single Barrel release). This mashbill consists of 60% corn, 35% rye, and 5% malted barley. The strain of yeast used is version “V” which is described as being delicate fruit, spicy, and creamy. This bottle came from warehouse PN and is barrel number 39-1C. It’s also interesting to note that Four Roses releases single barrel, barrel proof versions of all 10 of their recipes. These are available via private selection or as part of their now discontinued annual Limited Edition Single Barrel releases.","I’m greeted with an incredibly delicate and light nose. A bouquet of soft scents consisting of cork, dried raisins, vanilla, and fresh picked flowers wafts up from the glass. Also a very small amount of alcohol is detected upon first whiff. It’s a nice but incredibly subtle nose.","Wow, the palate is not what I expected after such a subtle nose. The most apt description is “Flavor Burst.” Upfront I’m greeted with a heavy dose of rye spice immediately followed by honey, peaches, and subtle hints of brown sugar and light oak. The palate isn’t deep as much as immediate, since you’re bombarded with all of the flavors at once. It coats your tongue ensuring you get a healthy dose of flavor with each sip. Truly a delicious tasting bourbon that makes me want to continuously go back and drink more.","This bourbon delivers a long, lingering finish, which has the exact opposite spice effect of the palate. With the palate, you’re greeted with spice upfront, quickly followed by a blast of flavors. With the finish, you’re initially greeted with very little spice, however that changes as my mouth is slowly filled with a delicious spicy heat over a minute or two. This spicy heat then takes another minute to slowly dissipate from my taste buds. Layered in between the rye spice are flavors of leather, old wood, mint, dried raisins, and cherries along with vanilla coated peaches. The length of this finish cannot be understated as it just keeps going and going.","Compared to other single barrels on the market, this one stands out for me due to the large amount of sweetness the palate contains, along with the large amount of rye in the mashbill. This bottle is well-balanced and full of flavor that smacks you around from start to finish. With the higher rye content, the flavor profile is unlike something you’d see coming out of Buffalo Trace or Heaven Hill. I’m usually hesitant to read a distillery’s description of a bottle, however the standard bottling Four Roses OBSV recipe really does live up to its description of “delicate fruit, spicy, and creamy.”

Single barrel bourbons, while unique, aren’t exactly rare nowadays. However what makes Four Roses stand apart is that they have 10 different recipes they use when making their blended bourbon. This means that they also have 10 different variations of single barrel recipes they can use for their Single Barrel product. While the standard bottling is always offered as OBSV at 100 proof, part of the fun of the Four Roses Single Barrel line is trying each recipe and finding what you like. This can also have a downside to it though, since non-standard bottlings can only be found as private picks. This means that sometimes you have to hunt around to find your favorite recipe.","For $40, you’re getting a pretty good value for your money. Four Roses delivers a bottle full of flavor that rewards you for spending your hard-earned money on the bottle. Sure, compared to other Four Roses products, (Four Roses Yellow and Four Roses Small Batch) the Single Barrel line costs more, however it also delivers a much more robust flavor profile. On top of being moderately priced, unlike some of the other single barrels on the market, you can usually find a bottle of the standard Four Roses single barrel all year round.","Full of flavor, regularly available on shelves, and a reasonable price… you can buy me a dozen of these roses any day of the week.","I found this bottle of Four Roses Single Barrel OBSV to be spicier than the Four Roses Small Batch, which I normally find to be a subtle balance of sweet and I often describe as a good beginner bourbon. I’d say a good description for the standard Single Barrel offering, is that it’s the grown-up version of their small batch product. The flavor is fuller, the finish is longer, and yes the price is higher, although justified in this case.

You have to hand it to Four Roses master distiller Jim Rutledge, as he certainly has a knack of picking delicious single barrels, and this bottle is no exception. The flavors are spot on for how Four Roses describes this specific recipe. While some may not rate the standard Four Roses Single Barrel as the best recipe offered by Four Roses, the consistent nature of the standard OBSV bottling is nothing to scoff at.

The best part of the Four Roses Single Barrel line is all of the different recipes that Jim has for you to choose from in the form of private selections. Each one is different, and finding the one that’s best suited to your flavor profile is part of the fun. I really recommend going out and trying as many different recipes as you can so you can find out what one is best suited for your preferences. I know that the three of us at Breaking Bourbon certainly look forward to doing a 10 recipe sampling at some point in the future.",Jordan,2.5,4,3.5,3.5,3,3.5,https://www.breakingbourbon.com/review/four-roses-single-barrel

It also marks the first permanent extension under Brent Elliott’s time as master distiller. Each of the bourbons in the blend is aged between 6 - 7 years.

Four Roses uses 2 different mashbills and 5 different yeast strains to create 10 unique bourbon recipes. Of those recipes, 6 are blended together to make Small Batch Select - OBSV, OBSK, OBSF, OESV, OESK, and OESF. By comparison Four Roses Small Batch  uses 4 of the 10 recipes - OBSO, OBSK, OESO and OESK. Four Roses Bourbon uses up to all 10 recipes.

The third letter is always S and designates the whiskey distillation, straight whiskey. The fourth letter designates the yeast strain, which can be V (delicate fruit), K (slight spice), O (rich fruit), Q (floral essence), or F (herbal notes).","Classic bourbon aromas of sweet vanilla, cinnamon and oak bark are the prominent scents. Beyond these is a sweet array of fruit cobbler, caramel, a touch of creme brulee, and spice. The nose has a pleasant amount of depth and brings forward a nice combination of sweet and fruity. I’d be remiss if I didn’t mention the ethanol. While it is 104 proof, there is a slight layer of ethanol present throughout, which I felt was holding back the nose from being great.","While the proof is noticeable in the nose, it’s well balanced and welcomed in the palate. The sip starts with a very prominent yet enjoyable blend of spices. Layers of heavy summer fruits blend nicely with a bold peppery blend which are joined by oak and vanilla. Even with all of the spice, the sip delivers a creamy mouthfeel. Overall it’s delicious and easy to appreciate.","The spice carries through to start off the finish. As it tapers off it’s joined by leather, a drier oak, and sweet vanilla. These flavors gently linger, resulting in a nice medium length finish. It’s a pleasant way to end the sip.","One of the most unique aspects of Four Roses is their multiple yeast strains and resulting 10 recipes. Thes 10 recipes each deliver a slightly different flavor profile and when blended, create a unique drinking experience. Many Four Roses purists will have a favorite recipe and always try to seek it out in single barrel form, while others will prefer a blend. Until now the blends were only offered in two readily available formats - Four Roses Small Batch which uses 4 recipes, and Four Roses Bourbon which uses up to all 10 recipes. Four Roses also offers a limited release blend about once a year, but it’s not readily available.

It turns out that utilizing 6 of the 10 recipes and upping the proof is the sweet spot for Four Roses for this new readily available blend. The combination of recipes chosen and additional proof ends up delivering a richer overall sip compared to Four Roses’ other blended bourbons. In particular, when compared directly to Four Roses Small Batch, Small Batch Select delivers a slightly creamier and richer sip. Yes the Single Barrel variation can deliver some stunning bottles now and then, however Small Batch Select should consistently deliver a unique sip with a great palate every time.","While it may be unique compared to its siblings, Four Roses Small Batch Select is also the most expensive in the Four Roses family now. Coming in at almost double the price of Four Roses Small Batch, and even more than Four Roses Single Barrel, its value discussion gets tricky. Yes the flavor profile is really unique, and the sip enjoyable, however it isn’t a large enough difference to justify its price. This isn’t a knock against Small Batch Select by any means, instead it’s more an acknowledgement of the value Four Roses delivers in their other three standard expressions.

In regards to the rest of the market, Small Batch Select is priced right. It doesn’t deliver the depth that a more fuller proof bourbon may deliver or the complexity that slightly longer aging often brings. However it delivers a consistent sipper at a price that is fair compared to its peers.  While it may seem expensive when viewed in the prism of Four Roses own brand lineup, its excellent palate, expected consistency, and wide availability all help to make Small Batch Select a decent overall value.","Readily available, full of flavor, and consistent, Four Roses Small Batch Select is the bottle of Four Roses no one knew they needed until now.","Four Roses Small Batch has always been a bourbon we recommend to those who are getting into bourbon and looking for a drinkable, yet flavorful bourbon. Four Roses Small Batch Select will now become one of my de facto bourbons that I recommend to those who are looking to expand into bourbons over 100 proof. This six recipe blend forms a sweet and spicy sip that is easily enjoyable by all, and the excellent palate helps to make its sum greater than its overall parts.

The price may seem hard to justify when compared to the standard Four Roses Single Barrel, which sells for less and is only four proof points lower, however the end result is worth the splurge. This will be my new always-have-on-hand bourbon that I keep in my collection, and one I recommend you try for yourself too.",Jordan,3,4,3,3.5,3,3.5,https://www.breakingbourbon.com/review/four-roses-small-batch-select-bourbon

The company also has a large single barrel program for retailers, and also sells their whiskey to numerous companies and non-distiller producers. Like the other large Tennessee distiller Jack Daniel’s, Dickel uses charcoal filtering, which they claim mellows their whiskey and creates a smooth mouthfeel.

To be labelled Bottled-in-Bond, the whiskey must be the product of one distillation season and one distiller at a single distillery, aged in a federally bonded warehouse under U.S. government supervision for at least four years, and it must be bottled at exactly 100 proof. Additionally, the Bottled-in-Bond label must clearly identify the distillery where it was distilled and where it was bottled, if different.","A deliciously sweet aroma of cherry, apple, vanilla, and oak with a hint of custard. It’s warming with the perfect amount of intensity that immediately makes a wonderful impression. An extra swirl of the glass further opens up the scents and builds to an impressive apex.","A tasty sweet mix of fruit punch, baking spice, toasted oak, pound cake, and faint roasted peanuts. It’s quite enjoyable and gets even better as you chew on it. To my surprise, doing this allows the flavors to further open up a great deal and become more expressive. The palate nails that perfect Dickel flavor profile you can find with certain single barrels from the company. It can come across as a bit hot for its proof - especially at first sip - but this isn’t that uncommon for Dickel whiskeys in my experience.","A hefty amount of spice and dry oak develops during its finish, grounding the whiskey. It’s uncomplicated as it hits hard and quickly fades. It’s a finish that’s not all that exciting, but more than adequate in its conciseness.","George Dickel Distillery must be one of the most prolific distilleries making whiskey. Where so many distilleries talk about their product shortages and resulting allocation, Dickel-made whiskey can be found practically everywhere. Their single barrel private selections are plentiful, and it seems like every Tom, Dick, and Harry craft distillery is now sourcing whiskey from them. It’s great that they are able to afford this practice as so many large distilleries cannot, but it also seems to have hurt their own core brand. The biggest splash the distillery has made recently is with their infamous “Hot Dickel” release in 2018.

Anyone that has had a great single barrel Dickel can attest to the fact that there is something special and distinctly Dickel tasting about them. Yet, outside of their single barrel program, the company very rarely has a product - limited or otherwise - available to showcase their distilling prowess. In many ways, they are to whiskey what MGP is to rye. They are more apt to allow someone else to showcase their whiskey than they are themselves. George Dickel Bottled in Bond finally goes to great measure to fix this, as it not only showcases the classic Dickel flavor profile proudly, it also shockingly comes in at an impressive 13 year age statement and amazing budget-friendly price point, which is rare in today’s whiskey marketplace.","It says something about a company that can produce excellent whiskey, yet they very rarely put out a noteworthy product with their name on it that showcases it. They finally fixed this in 2019, but it wasn’t an uber-expensive special release, rather an inexpensive one following their already budget-friendly Dickel No. 8 and Dickel No. 12 whiskeys. George Dickel Bottled in Bond released at only $36, but it was the inclusion of its 13 year age statement that was most shocking. Then you factor in its overall quality and very likeable flavor profile and you end up with a product that not only showcases what Dickel can produce, but also their willingness to shake up the industry.

Any 13 year old whiskey catches attention nowadays, but it generally comes with the expectation that it will likely be a $100 or more product. When it was revealed George Dickel Bottled in Bond would cost $36, it didn’t jive with current pricing standards. People were left scratching their heads, then curiosity set in, and inevitably, an impulse purchase was made. It’s a clever angle backed up with an excellent product that will likely prove to be quite profitable for Dickel, and a great value for drinkers.",George Dickel Bottled in Bond is an impressive tasting whiskey with an equally impressive age statement and price.,"When Dickel announced they were going to release a bottled in bond whiskey it didn’t immediately instill much excitement in people. With Dickel-made whiskey being offered from so many other companies over the last few years, the immediate reaction could fairly be described as “been there, done that.” While learning of its price point and age was impressive, did anyone really have high expectations for a new $36 whiskey?

To be fair George Dickel Bottled in Bond does come across as a bit hot and oak forward the first couple of sips, but as it opens up, an impressive array of classic sweet Dickel flavors comes out. It joins a slew of budget-friendly and impressive tasting whiskeys from the last few years. 1792 Single Barrel, Old Ezra 7 Year Barrel Strength, Larceny Barrel Proof Batch A120, Four Roses Small Batch Select Bourbon, Stagg Jr Batch 12, and now George Dickel Bottled in Bond, are all leading the way of a new renaissance of excellent whiskeys at consumer-friendly prices.

George Dickel Bottled in Bond is a great whiskey and Dickel deserves a lot of credit for all they accomplished with this product. Dickel No. 12 was already a decent tasting product at a great value, but Bottle in Bond upstages it in every category. If the company can maintain the age statement and quality of Bottled in Bond, they have the opportunity of a runaway success on their hands.",Eric,4,3.5,3,3.5,4.5,3.5,https://www.breakingbourbon.com/review/george-dickel-bottled-in-bond-whisky
,Heaven Hill Select Stock Cognac Finished,Classification: Straight Bourbon Finished in Cognac Barrels,Company: Heaven Hill,Distillery: Heaven Hill,Released: Ongoing (Gift Shop only),Proof: 124.4,Age: 8 year old bourbon finished in a cognac barrel for 21 months,"Mashbill: 68% Corn, 20% Wheat, 12% Malted Barley",Color: Deep Amber,MSRP: $150 (2016),Official Website,The bottle being reviewed was hand selected for Heaven Hill’s Bourbon Heritage Center in Bardstown Kentucky and is only sold on site. It’s an 8 year old wheated bourbon finished in a cognac barrel for 21 months. It was aged in Rickhouse J on Floor 6 on the Rack/Tier: 0-0. The barrel serial number it was produced from is 44824-44835. It was distilled on 09/24/03 and was bottled on 11/01/14.,"The additional cognac barrel aging is evident right from the start. Rich is the best way to describe this nose. Toasted sugar, vanilla, creme brulee, dark berries, spiced raisins, and aged oak lightly dance out of the glass. For a 124.4 proof bourbon, I’m surprised how extremely little alcohol is present. This allows the bourbon to come across as more mellow with rich undertones that are clearly influenced by the additional time the bourbon spent in the cognac barrel, and makes me excited to take a sip each time. The rich scents become more prominent with additional exposure to air.","This is where the influence of the cognac barrel seems most evident. Plump juicy raisins that have been soaked in syrup, dark berries, a bit of grain, aged oak, and hints of toasted sugar and light caramel all nicely play together. Much like the nose, the palate comes across as mellow and refined, however it also tends to lean slightly to the dry side, though this shouldn’t be interpreted as a fault by any means. Additionally there’s a bit of heat in the palate, but nothing so unmanageable that you can’t swirl this around the inside of your mouth to pick out the flavors and enjoy.","Aged oak is a consistent flavor throughout and the finish is no exception to this. Oak is the driving flavor in this finish, but I also find it contains gratifying hints of leather, pepper, raisins, and dark dry chocolate. It lingers for a while with a warming oaky dry aftertaste being present. This finishes older than its age and if you had me taste this blind I would have guessed this to be more of a 14-16 year old bourbon. It’s not bad by any means, however it doesn’t quite shine as brightly as the palate.","From a high level view, the individual components of Select Stock aren’t groundbreaking by any means. For starters, you can buy a wheated barrel proof bourbon any time you wish thanks to Maker’s Mark Cask Strength or by visiting the Maker’s Mark gift shop for Maker's 46 Cask Strength, and let’s not forget the hard to get your hands on William Larue Weller. Additionally, barrel finished bourbons and whiskeys in general are becoming more and more commonplace and run the gamut of the various alcohol barrel types the whiskey is finished in, including Angel’s Envy Finished Rye, 1792 Port Finish, Barrell Whiskey Batch 002, and High West’s Yippee Ki-Yay to name a few. Even the type of finish, in this case a cognac barrel, isn’t new as Heaven Hill’s Parker’s Heritage Collection 5th edition was a rye based bourbon finished in cognac barrels and Belle Meade produces a cognac finished bourbon too. Finally, the age of the bourbon certainly isn’t unique nor is the amount of time it was barrel finished.

However, the magic with this bourbon is when you combine all of its individual components together. A wheated barrel proof bourbon that has been barrel finished in a cognac barrel for 21 months is certainly unique. Not only that but the flavor profile it offers is delicious. It’s a great bourbon that makes you want to pair it with a rich creme brulee or a nice dish of rich handmade vanilla ice cream to help complement it. I’m looking forward to taking on the hard job of experimenting to find out what desserts this pairs best with in the future.","Value is something that’s always hard to rate, as the value lies in the eye of the beholder. To some, paying a premium for a unique barrel finished whiskey that also happens to be a barrel proof wheater is well worth the price of admission. To others, anything over $100 needs to blow them out of the water to justify the price. As tasty and unique as this bourbon is, at $150, this personally gives me pause. Yes the bourbon is quite delicious, and I would definitely like to have another in my collection, however I would also like to see this sold for about $50 less.

For those interested in trying a barrel finished whiskey, you can find examples in the market that are good and unique for a lot less. 1792 Port Finish and Angel’s Envy Finished Rye are two that immediately come to mind, and both sell for significantly less. In fact for the price of Select Stock, you could buy a bottle of each and still walk away with money in your pocket.",A unique delicious tasting barrel proof wheated bourbon finished in cognac barrels that can best be summed up as rich...both in flavor profile and in price!,"Sure this may not be Heaven Hill’s first go around with a cognac barrel finished bourbon, however that shouldn’t make it any less enticing. While this is priced higher than I would like to see it, I do think this is a unique tasting bourbon that I can easily see being loved by most who experience it. The rich, easy to distinguish flavor elements provide a perfect balance between bourbon and cognac. It’s a shame this isn’t offered outside of their Bourbon Heritage Gift Shop in Kentucky since I’m sure many people would appreciate the chance to try this, even if it’s only a glass at their favorite bourbon bar.",Jordan,3.5,4,3,3.5,1.5,3.5,https://www.breakingbourbon.com/review/heaven-hill-select-stock-cognac-finished
In Depth Review,Heaven’s Door Double Barrel Whiskey,Classification: Whiskey Finished in New Toasted Oak Barrels,Company: Heaven's Door Spirits,Distillery: Sourced from an undisclosed distillery[ies],Release Date: Ongoing,Proof: 100,Age: NAS,Mashbill: Undisclosed (Blend of three whiskeys),Color: Bronze,MSRP: $50,Official Website,"Heaven's Door Spirits is a collaboration between legendary artist Bob Dylan and Spirits Investment Partnership (""SIP""). Bob Dylan's first and only brand partnership, Heaven's Door is aimed to be an ever-evolving portfolio of handcrafted whiskeys in collaboration with different master distillers and blenders from across the country. According to the company's press release, Marc Bushala, CEO of SIP said, ""Rather than make a single whiskey or work with one master distiller, we thought it would be far more interesting to work with various master distillers and blenders to make whiskeys that would each have their own unique signature.""

The company's initial trilogy of releases includes a Straight Tennessee Bourbon, a Double Barrel Whiskey, and a Straight Rye Whiskey finished in ""Cigar"" Barrels from Vosges, France. Heaven’s Door Double Barrel Whiskey consists of a combination of three different whiskeys that are blended together and finished in hand toasted new American oak barrels for an additional year. Heaven’s Door inaugural releases were created by Ryan Perry of Heaven’s Door Spirits and master distiller Jordan Via, formerly of the Breckenridge Distillery.

According to the company, each bottle of Heaven’s Door showcases Dylan’s distinctive welded iron gates that he created in his studio Black Buffalo Ironworks. The gates consist of found objects collected from farms and scrap yards across the U.S.","Rich aged oak immediately greets you. Taking a deep inhale reveals scents of light hints of baked cinnamon, vanilla, butterscotch, and peanuts lying in wait. The main focus though is the oakiness, which clearly dominates the nose and helps usher in a very nicely balanced opening to the sip.","Deep buttery brown sugar swirled with cinnamon jumps to the front. Behind it lies a layer of oak combined with a sweet vanilla, light cinnamon apple, and hints of cherries. The secondary barreling process is evident here as the sweeter flavors from the wood are pulled forward while still showcasing a heavy amount of rich oak. It’s not overly complex, instead focusing on a robust mouthfeel that is perfectly balanced in its delivery of sweet and woody flavors. It’s a combination that is extremely pleasing and hard to beat.","The finish focuses more on drier flavors compared to the sweeter ones found in the nose and palate, and opens with drier oak, leather, hints of peppercorn, and light vanilla. Drier leather and oak pull forward and linger, while flashes of peanuts dash in and out. It’s a pleasing flavor profile is a nice way to end the sip.","Celebrity endorsed products are usually approached with a sense of caution. Oftentimes the products are subpar, getting a huge boost and more attention than they deserve due to the name associated with it. Going into sampling Heaven’s Door Double Barrel Whiskey, I had those same hesitations. It’s safe to say that they bucked the trend with this one.

The three whiskeys being blended and aged in the secondary toasted oak barrel just work together. There is a clear oak influence that is strong in some parts of the sip, but never to the point where it is a distraction. Heaven’s Door Double Barrel Whiskey is a whiskey drinkers’ whiskey first and foremost, with an association with Bob Dylan as a fun ornamental aspect to it. The whiskey delivers an all around pleasing pour with a particularly strong palate that is sure to please most who try it.

More so, I like the concept that Heaven’s Door is going after in terms of how their whiskeys are crafted. While they’re not only sourcing their whiskeys, they’re also sourcing their master distillers. This allows the company a broad variation in what they deliver to the marketplace, with each new lineup of whiskeys having the potential to breathe new life into the brand. This level of flexibility and variation is refreshing to see and makes me excited about the possibilities yet to come.","Heaven’s Door Double Barrel Whiskey comes in at $50 and is priced slightly higher than other double barrel whiskeys such as Woodford Reserve Double Oak or Heaven Hill’s Elijah Craig Toasted Barrel Finished Bourbon. However, it delivers a slightly richer overall sip than those that justifies its price.

What holds this back from being anything other than an average value is truly the lack of information associated with what is in the bottle. No information is readily available on what source whiskeys go into this product, their age, or their associated mashbills. All you’re told is that they’re mingled and aged for an additional year in the second toasted oak barrel. For the price I would expect more information to be provided to the consumer.","Heaven’s Door Double Barrel Whiskey should be held up as an example of how to do celebrity affiliated whiskeys: deliver a rich satisfying sip first, with a celebrity tie-in second.","Heaven’s Door Double Barrel Whiskey delivers one of those pleasing sips that most whiskey lovers are bound to like. While the lack of information provided on the actual whiskey in the bottle is disappointing, there is no denying that the end result helps overcome that shortfall. Its unique and intriguing bottle shape and artwork may draw you in, but the whiskey inside will keep you coming back for more. Is this whiskey knocking on heaven’s door of perfection? No. (Could this review have ended without at least one reference to the song?) However, if you’re a fan of double barreled whiskey, a lover of oaky flavors, or just a Bob Dylan fan, give this a go as I think you’ll walk away pleasantly surprised. I know I did.",Jordan,3.5,4,3,3.5,2.5,3.5,https://www.breakingbourbon.com/review/heavens-door-double-barrel-whiskey
,High West 14 Year Old Light Whiskey,Classification: Light Whiskey,Company: High West,Distillery: Sourced (from MGP formerly LDI),Released: April 2016,Proof: 92,Age: 14 Years,"Mashbill: 99% Corn, 1% Malted Barley",Color:  Straw,MSRP: $100,Official Website,"In order to be classified as Light Whiskey in the U.S., the whiskey must be produced at more than 80% abv [but less than 95% abv] and stored in used or uncharred new oak containers. According to High West, typically in North America, light whiskey gets blended with heavier straight whiskey to make blended Canadian (estimated to be greater than 95% of all Canadian whiskey) as well as most American blended whiskeys that are not blended straight whiskeys.

This is a limited release that is sold at High West’s Blue Sky Ranch Distillery and Saloon & Distillery locations located in Wanship and Park City Utah, respectively. This whiskey consists of an MGP light whiskey mashbill, which they state on their website usually consists of 99% corn and 1% barely malt. According to High West, they sourced 100 barrels of light whiskey from MGP produced between 1999 and 2001 and aged in second-fill barrels.","While not deep, the nose is inviting. If you’re a vanilla fan, you’re in for a treat as the nose is predominantly made up of heavy doses of vanilla. Lightly layered under the vanilla are traces of sweet caramel and touches of honey; all of which are trailed by a clear ethanol undertone. The ethanol doesn’t take away from the nose by any means, but it also makes its presence known with each deep inhale I take.","The nose set me up for a palate I wasn’t ready for. I assumed I was about to encounter a pretty one-dimensional palate. Instead, I’m blown away by what greets me. A lush palate full of light chocolate, berries, sweet frozen grapes, and honey are all entwined by rich vanilla. It sounds like a weird combination, but all of the sweet flavors play nicely together and form a delicious palate overall.

Where the ethanol made itself known in the nose, the palate contains very little heat and I’m able to roll the whiskey around my mouth thanks in part to the fact that there's almost no burn. The palate consists of a great viscosity that, while not super heavy, is a nice weight that coats your mouth perfectly. Really unexpected and well done.","The vanilla continues to shine through the finish and is the predominant trait once again. I’m also greeted with ever so faint hints of caramel and oak and the fleeing ghosts of sugary fruits found in the palate. The finish lingers for a while with an enjoyable vanilla flavor that slowly fades away well after I take a sip, yet it doesn’t hold a candle to the palate that preceded it.","I give High West credit for releasing a light whiskey to the market. I have to admit that up until this release, I hadn’t had a chance to try a light whiskey before and didn’t know too much about the concept. This isn’t for lack of trying, rather the fact that no major American Whiskey distiller that I know of regularly produces a light whiskey and bottles it as such for consumer purchase. If you’re interested in more of the backstory about how light whiskey came to be in the U.S., Chuck Cowdery did a great in-depth write-up.

Additionally, the entire time I was tasting this whiskey, I forgot that I was drinking a 14 year old whiskey. The whiskey is so light and vibrant in taste that I’d bet good money if I had someone blind taste test this, they would peg it for a whiskey at least half its age. It’s amazing that it’s spent so much time in the wood, but doesn’t taste at all woody. This whiskey is one that’s really interesting and unlike anything I’ve experienced with a whiskey aged this long.","The going rate for special distillery-only High West releases tends to be $100 or more, and once again High West hits this target for their 14 Year Old Light Whiskey. On the one hand you’re paying for the ability to try a type of whiskey that you normally don’t come across everyday in the American marketplace. On the other hand, this whiskey, while tasty, isn’t very deep outside of the palate, and might let down those who are looking for a deeper tasting experience for the money.

When compared to other one-time cheaper limited releases on the market, such as Barrell Bourbon’s excellent Batch 005 or 006, 14 Year Old Light Whiskey just doesn’t stack up in flavor or in price. I can see this being more of an impulse buy for people who are touring the distillery and want to take home something special that they can’t find in the marketplace. Just realize that if you do find yourself in this situation, you’re paying a high price to try a type of whiskey that normally isn’t produced to sell to consumers and while enjoyable, is generally basic outside of the palate for the high price of admission.","It’s a shame High West isn’t distributing this outside of their on-site gift shops, as this 14 Year Old Light Whiskey is one tasty whiskey that’s as easy to drink as they come.","The best way to summarize this whiskey is like the log ride at an amusement park. You start off unsure of what to expect in the nose as the ride slowly pulls you up the hill, followed by an amazing thrill as you rush down and taste the palate. Ultimately, the finish leaves you satisfied, but you yearn to go back and experience the thrill of the ride again. Thankfully that’s easy to accommodate, since this is an easy drinker.

Yes the price tag is high for what it is, but personally I really liked this whiskey and I’d probably buy a bottle if I came across one. However being a distillery-only release, and one that’s not the easiest to get to, that probably won’t be happening anytime soon. And that’s the ultimate shame of it all. While I think the new High West Blue Sky Ranch Distillery is gorgeous to experience in person, it’s also one that not many people will go out of their way to visit unless they're already nearby for another event. I really wish High West would have offered half of their stock for their onsite sales, and the other half to sell on the open market. Unless High West decides to start buying MGP light whiskey in bulk and aging it for mass production and distribution, it’s a shame more people won’t get a chance to at least try this. Especially since this light whiskey is a really interesting experience and a great way to continue one's whiskey education.

,High West A Midwinter Nights Dram Act 2.1,Classification: Rye,Company: High West,Distillery: Sourced (6 year from LDI now MGP and 16 year from Barton Distillery),Released: October 2014,Proof: 98.6,Age: Blend of 6 & 16 year of rye whiskeys,"Mashbill: 6 yr rye has 95% rye and 5% barley (LDI now MGP), 16 yr rye has 80% rye, 10% corn, 10% barley (Barton Distillery)",Color:  Deep Mahogany,MSRP: $90,Official Website,Act 2.1 Scene 868. This is a limited yearly release of Rendezvous Rye finished in port and French oak barrels. Per High West’s website this is “a very unique rye that tastes like the flavors of Christmas.”,"The smell of rich red wine is at the forefront. Raspberries and a hint of rye spice also pull through. Is there a hint of baking fruit pie in there? I want to say it reminds me of the smell of some kind of dessert freshly baking, I just can’t put my finger on it. One thing is certain though, it’s definitely a blend of red wine and whiskey on the nose, with the red wine dominating.","Dark fruit is prominent, cherries and raspberries specifically. It coats the mouth and tongue nicely giving a rich, velvety mouthfeel. There’s less spice than with the standard Rendezvous Rye, but about the same level of complexity. Like the smell, the taste is blend of dark red wine and whiskey although the whiskey dominates on the palate.","No new flavors make themselves present. Fades away softly. Medium length and not very spicy, but warming none-the-less.","Barrel finished whiskey is becoming more and more popular. It adds a flair of excitement and separation from the masses. “Look at all those ryes… but wait, this one is barrel finished!” Although different, barrel finished does not necessarily mean good. It’s the equivalent of adding some flavoring to our whiskey, just in a more romantic way than simply measuring and dumping. That said, A Midwinter Nights Dram is a barrel finished success. High West starts with the standard Rendezvous Rye and manages to impart some deep fruity flavors from the port wine barrel finishing that tames the spice and gives this a thick, velvety mouthfeel. High West claims this “tastes like the flavors of Christmas,” which I’d say isn’t a very far stretch. It definitely seems like something I could see myself sipping around a fire in the presence of family and friends. Even it’s reddish hue alludes to a Christmas theme.","The value delivered by this whiskey is that fact that it’s been blended and finished so elegantly. As mentioned before in some ways there is nothing else quite like it, so that can dictate a higher price. Compared with the High West's Rendezvous Rye at $50, this is quite a bit more expensive. There is additional cost to age it longer though, which must be considered. This is also a fairly limited release and we don’t really know how much more will be released in the future, if any. For those reasons, this is worth getting your hands on a bottle to try and I think it’s priced fairly. I would definitely buy again when this bottle runs out, although I think that may be a while.",A barrel finished success delivering a very different experience than that found in the original Rendezvous Rye.,"I have a love-hate with barrel finished whiskeys. I’m always interested in them, but have never found one that’s become a staple in my day-to-day pours. I can love one on one day, then hate it the next. Despite that, they have their time and place. A Midwinter Nights Dram certainly claims its time and place. It’s a welcomed composition of flavors suitable for special occasions during the colder months as High West’s marketing suggests. It’s been nearly impossible to find since it first hit the market, and the overall response from the community has been positive. Even if this was widely accessible and lower priced, I will say it would never become one of my daily drinkers. I would reserve it for certain occasions and those times when I’m itching to share it with friends wanting something a little different. I do sincerely hope this becomes a regular annual release for High West and it creates further excitement for what is yet to come from this company.

Having trouble finding A Midwinter Nights Dram? I experimented a little bit and was able to put together something that echoed similar flavors. It’s not the real thing of course, but like “Poor Man’s Pappy” this may get you close. Grab your bottle of Rendezvous Rye and your favorite red wine. Pour an ounce of the Rendezvous, then put about 3-6 drops of the red wine into it. You’ll have to experiment a little with different red wines and the number of drops you use, but I found the end result to be similar in general flavor characteristics to A Midwinter Nights Dram. If you get the formula right, fill up your decanter and now you’re ready for a night by the fire with some friends.",Nick,3,4,3,5,2.5,3.5,https://www.breakingbourbon.com/review/high-west-a-midwinter-nights-dram-act-2-1

This only adds up to 90%).",Color:  Light Copper,MSRP: $50 (2014),Official Website,"This is High West’s Double Rye (a blend of 2 & 16 yr ryes) rebarreled in their used Campfire whiskey (a blend of bourbon/rye/scotch) barrels for an extra 25 months. This was a private selection bottle for Caskers and is barrel number 488-2, bottle number 41.","It still has the rye backbone of the Double Rye, but the barrel finish introduces layers of smoke, leather, fruit, floral scents, and pine to its nose. It’s interesting how much the rye scent takes a backseat to the more powerful aromas of the campfire whiskey. This might be a tell-tale sign of how much influence this additional barrel finish had on the Double Rye as a whole.","This is quite the assemblage of flavors. At first sip, all of the flavors can be overwhelming. There is a lot going on with the palate of this whiskey. After a few sips you can start to pick out each of the flavors. That great Double Rye flavor again creates the backbone of the palate. Then more of the whiskey flavors of nutmeg, tobacco, vanilla and toffee mingle in. The unique scotchy and smokey Campfire Whiskey flavor rounds out the palate.","Despite being eight proof points higher than the standard Double Ryeblend, this is an incredibly smooth bourbon at 100 proof. For fans of a hot finish, this almost has none. At the same time though, it really allows you the chance to dissect all of the layers of flavor and you’ll need it. A lot of the palate’s flavors blend together on the way down and in a way, cancel each other out. On the plus side, the aftertaste of this whiskey is dominated by a fried dough/funnel cake notes. Yum.","On paper, this whiskey reads like a science experiment or something your kid came up with at the dinner table. Despite appearing like it’s the kitchen-sink style approach to whiskey blending/finishing, the end result is far from a trainwreck. I’ve never been a fan of any barrel finished whiskey as they always seem like they’re less like whiskey and more like something else entirely. Surprisingly, I found this Double Rye - Campfire Finish very interesting and very drinkable. There’s nothing else out on the American whiskey market that tastes like it.","At a $15 premium over the standard MSRP of High West’s Double Rye, this is a great price for this unique whiskey. Most premium whiskeys, which often have very unique traits, are priced a lot higher than $50. High West’s own A Midwinter Nights Dram is priced in the $80-$90 range and when it comes down to it, I’d grab this Double Rye Campfire finish over it because of the drastic price difference. To put it in perspective: you're getting the fantastic High West Double Rye as the base of this whiskey that is then capped off with a very drinkable, one-of-a-kind finish, for $50.",A concoction of flavors that surprisingly makes for a very drinkable one-of-a-kind whiskey.,"finished bourbon it might not be for everyone, but I found this whiskey’s barrel finish a fascinating experiment. It added a lot of layers of flavor that transformed the whiskey and instead of overpowering it, or worse, spoiling it, it turned it into something special. It’s still not the easiest whiskey to find, but it seems like High West is taking great strides to expand their brand within the confines of their current line. This could mean that we see a lot more of their “Barrel Select” program in the years ahead.",Eric,3,3.5,2.5,4.5,4.5,3.5,https://www.breakingbourbon.com/review/high-west-double-rye-campfire-finish
,High West Double Rye Manhattan Finish,Classification: Blend of Straight Rye Whiskeys,Company: High West,Distillery: Sourced (2 year from LDI now MGP and 16 year from Barton Distillery),Released: November 2015,Proof: 104.8,Age: Blend of 2 & 16 year rye whiskey,"Mashbill: 2 year rye has 95% rye and 5% barley, 16 year rye has barely legal 53% rye and 37% corn (plus something else High West? This only adds up to 90%).",Color:  Deep Copper,MSRP: $53 (2015),Official Website,"The bottle being reviewed is bottle number 91 from barrel number 2927. This particular barrel was chosen by the Single Barrel Project which Breaking Bourbon took part in. This particular Double Rye was aged an additional 9 months in a barrel that had been used twice before; first used to age a rye for 2 years, then used to age High West’s barrel-aged Manhattan, and finally for it’s third use in this particular bottling.


Additionally this version comes in at 12.8 proof points higher than the standard High West Double Rye, which is bottled at 92 proof.","If you’re looking for a classic rye profile on the nose, you’ve come to the wrong place. That being said, you’re still greeted with a great nose. On first pass it smells as if someone made a Manhattan versus pouring rye whiskey into my glass. I’m immediately hit with the smells of Maraschino cherries, sweet vermouth, and a healthy dose of alcohol vapors which you normally don’t find in the standard High West Double Rye. Lingering longer I notice hints of angostura bitters, field grass, light oak, and then finally your typical Double Rye.","The influence of the extra aging in the Manhattan barrels is immediately evident in full force on the palate. The standard profile and spice of the Double Rye takes a back seat on this bottle. On first sip, I’m immediately greeted with an immensely sweet rye, with Maraschino cherries that have been soaked in a lightly spiced rye. Hiding behind the Maraschino cherries is a slight hint of licorice along with sweet vanilla and a noticeable amount of oak. It’s not a super deep palate, however what it does contain, it highlights nicely. This is such a radical change from the standard Double Rye that you would be hard-pressed to realize it started as the same base whiskey if you were to do a blind side-by-side comparison.","The typical rye flavor profile missing in the nose and palate makes itself known in this long finish. While the taste of cherries continues to pull through, I am mainly greeted with classic rye spice flavors. Additionally, the finish has a pleasant low heat that lingers for quite some time allowing me to enjoy it for several minutes after each sip. To me this will be perfect to sip on and enjoy when you just want to take a quiet moment to relax and enjoy nothing more than contemplating a nice, complex glass of whiskey.","This is one of the more unique barrel-finished whiskeys I’ve had. I’m not sure if it’s best to describe it as an over-proofed Manhattan or an over-sweetened Double Rye. Either way, the flavor profile is one I haven’t found in any other product on the market. Additionally, at 104.8 proof you’re getting a chance to taste a higher proof High West whiskey which is not very common. It makes me wish that they’d release more of their whiskeys at higher proofs because with the exception of the nose, the flavors really pop without imparting too much alcohol on the flavor profile. It’s interesting to note that the standard Double Rye also pops without much alcohol in the profile, which might be evidence that this is the reason for it as opposed to the barrel-finishing.","At only a $15 premium over the MSRP of the standard High West Double Rye, this is a great price for this unique whiskey. It’s right in line with the pricing you usually see for other barrel-finished High West whiskeys. To put this in comparison, High West’s own barrel-finished Manhattan, “36th Vote Barreled Manhattan,” retails for $45. While that product offers you a nice premade Manhattan, with this bottling you’re able to get a bold, higher than average proof High West product that brings with it a unique Manhattan inspired flavor profile. A fantastic offering for the price.",A fantastic Manhattan-forward rye that exemplifies just how much of an influence barrel-finishing can have on the end result.,"Seeing that I was part of the group that went to High West to choose this particular barrel, we choose it for a reason. The unique and fantastic flavor profile is incredibly delicious and something that I just haven’t found in anything else on the market. While this was a one-off bottling for the Single Barrel Project, High West does do this style for other private selections as well. In fact, I’ve noticed private store selections pop up from time to time, with the major retailer Binny’s being an example of a retailer that has offered private barrels of this particular offering in the past. While each barrel will offer its own unique nuances, my assumption is the basic underlying flavor profile will be found in other barrels as well.

It should be noted however that this barrel-finished rye won’t be for everyone. If you’re not a fan of Manhattans or sweeter flavor profiles, you’ll probably want to stay away. Additionally, if you’re looking for a classic rye flavor profile, you won’t find it with this bottle. That said, if you’re at all inclined to enjoy a sweeter flavor profile or just looking to try something new, I’d highly recommend a hunting down a similar bottle from another private selection. You won’t be disappointed.",Jordan,3,4,3,3.5,4,3.5,https://www.breakingbourbon.com/review/high-west-double-rye-manhattan-finish
,High West Rocky Mountain Rye 16 Year,Classification: Straight Rye,Company: High West,Distillery: Barton & LDI (Seagram's now MGP),"Released: September 7, 2015",Proof: 92,Age: 16 Years,Mashbill: Undisclosed,Color:  Dark Copper,MSRP: $125 (2015),Official Website,"This whiskey will be released at the grand opening of the company’s new distillery at Blue Sky Ranch in Wanship, Utah. It will only be available at the gift shop until supplies run out. An estimated 1,300 bottles have been produced for this release. The whiskey is a blend of 16 year old Barton rye and a 17 year old LDI (Seagram's) rye. Batch Number:1SG07, Bottle number 1257","It opens with inviting notes of baking spices and a bit of fresh fruit. It almost smells youthful at first but not in the typical harsh way. With a few minutes in the glass the nose progresses to warmer and more developed notes of caramel, honey, gingerbread, and oak, along with fainter hints of orange and lemon. It’s not overly complex, nor overly oaked, which is a surprise from a blend of 16 year and 17 year old ryes. Overall a really nice opening.","Many of the notes from the nose carry over to the palate. Baking spices, gingerbread, vanilla, and caramel easily stick out the most. Like many of High West’s rye blends, the palate isn’t incredibly complex. It definitely tastes sweeter than some of their other offerings and that might be the whiskey’s main sticking point. The spice, while present, is dialed back and mingles with the sweet notes differently than most rye whiskeys. All of this makes for a very approachable whiskey.","Except for a slight trace of a semi-dry oaky aftertaste, I’m surprised at how fast the finish drops off and leaves almost no flavor on the tongue. It’s almost like a magic trick: there one second, gone the next. The whiskey has a nice mouthfeel and some weight to it as it begins to go down, but then immediately thins out once it does. Despite all of this sounding negative, I wouldn’t call the finish necessarily bad. I just wish the flavors stuck around longer. Thankfully it leaves just the right amount on burn on the way down to remind you that it was there.","High aged ryes are a rarity. One of the main reasons is because ryes generally taste better under the 10 year mark. Of course there are exceptions to this, namely Sazerac 18 Year, Willett Family Estate ryes, Rittenhouse 21-25 years, and even High West’s other high aged ryes. Hearing over and over from master distillers how difficult it is to properly age bourbon for a high number of years, aging rye for the same number of years might be even harder since there are so few available. Any time a high age rye hits the market, it’s reason enough to take notice.

High West has yet again turned to what they do best: blending. Where some of the company’s other ryes are blends of young and old, this edition of Rocky Mountain Rye is a blend of 16-year-old Barton rye and a 17-year-old LDI rye. Blending young and old ryes makes a lot of sense as it helps smooth out the highs and lows that rye often has. However, many high-aged ryes are often heavily oaked, so blending only high aged ryes with a good results must be a trial of tribulations.

Rocky Mountain Rye 16 Year shares a lot of similarities to High West’s last high aged rye, Rocky Mountain Rye 21 Year. Mainly, both keep their oak notes in check and are both very smooth drinkers. The 16 Year is also sweeter than most ryes, which makes for an interesting interplay with the rye spice. Many people don’t like to drink rye whiskey because they often describe it as harsh or too spicy. Someone would be hard pressed to describe Rocky Mountain Rye 16 Year in that regard. For what it is, this edition of Rocky Mountain Rye is unique enough in its own right much like the the two in the series before it.","At $125 and only available at the distillery, this whiskey really has to prove itself for someone to make a special trip for this bottle. Blending two high aged ryes together is a rarity and the overall flavor profile is above-average, but any bourbon or rye priced above $100 these days is going to be looked over with a magnifying glass by discerning whiskey enthusiasts. Despite a market that will support high-priced whiskey, the real question for true enthusiasts is: “Is it worth its asking price?”

That answer of course depends on what you’re looking for. Even in a world where Rittenhouse 21-25 Year is long gone, Sazerac 18 and Van Winkle Family Reserve have become unicorn whiskeys and Willett’s Family Estate Rye bottles are dying out, $125 may still be too expensive for this whiskey. Yes, it’s a tasty rye that is on the sweeter side and has a perfect amount of oak notes, but it’s just not at the same level as other high end ryes. Again it’s a very enjoyable whiskey, but there’s nothing about it’s flavor profile jumps and screams “classic.” That said, the price is still within the realm (even below) of current [ultra] limited edition releases. With an estimated 1,300 bottles being released, High West could have easily charged double for this and many on the secondary market will ask that or even much more. Essentially, don’t hate the player; hate the game.",A sweet flavor profile with a near-perfect amount of oak makes for a very approachable rye that diehards will still wish was a bit more complex.,"High West Rocky Mountain Rye 16 Year is an easy whiskey to like. It’s smooth, sweet, and incredibly easy to drink. If you’re not scared off by it’s price tag you’ll probably be satisfied by your purchase. It doesn’t hold up to other legendary high aged ryes, but maybe it doesn’t have to. Whiskey diehards will probably find its price and quality don’t quite match, but with little direct competition in its age range and it’s very approachable nature, that might be enough to win over the masses.

With the High West’s new distillery opening for in-house distillation, this is a turning point for the company. High West is committing to long-term whiskey making and a future where they can control their own product more. With Rocky Mountain Rye 16 Year the company was only able to source a few barrels for this release and with only an estimated 1,300 bottles available, few will get the chance to taste this. We’ve seen High West’s attention to detail and quality in everything they do so far, and this is no exception. While whiskey sourcing and blending is a different skill set than distillation, the opening of the new distillery is a giant leap forward for a company whose future looks bright.",Eric,3.5,3,2.5,4,2.5,3.5,https://www.breakingbourbon.com/review/high-west-rocky-mountain-rye-16-year
,Hillrock Estate Solera Aged Bourbon,Classification: Bourbon,Company: Hillrock Estate Distillery,Distillery: Blend of sourced bourbon (from an undisclosed source) and Hillrock Estate distilled bourbon,Released: Ongoing,Proof: 92.6,Age: NAS,Mashbill: Undisclosed,Color:  Reddish Amber,MSRP: $90 (2017),Official Website,"Hillrock Estate Distillery is a farm distillery with roots dating back to 1806, located in New York’s Hudson Valley approximately two hours north of New York City. Hillrock is the first company to offer solera aged bourbon beginning in October 2012, though other companies have followed suit with a handful of other solera aged bourbons currently available. Hillrock was founded by Jeffrey Baker and is collaborating with Master Distiller Dave Pickerell (formerly of Maker’s Mark).

From Hillrock’s website: “‘Solera’ - a stack of barrels where a small portion of whiskey is removed periodically and new whiskey is added. No barrel is ever fully emptied, and age and complexity gradually increase over time. Hillrock marries small barrel-aged Hillrock Estate Bourbon with mature seed bourbon before finishing in 20 year-old Oloroso Sherry casks to balance the flavors and add layers of complexity… Current average age of the Hillrock Solera Bourbon is over 6 years and the rye content is approximately 37%.”

The bottle in review is from Barrel No. 45.","Upfront I notice dark fruit, a hint of rye spice, and something floral. This is accompanied by the slightest tickle of alcohol on the nostrils. Overall it’s very light and sweet smelling, making for a nice, yet ever-so-subtle nose.","The palate is full-bodied, yet light and delicate at the same time. Ironically it seems boring on the surface, but take your time with it and it offers a good deal of depth and complexity. Its lack of burn allows me to roll it around in my mouth as long as I want to, coating my tongue and contemplating the flavors. The influence of the Oloroso Sherry casks is quite evident, with notes of sweet dark fruits taking the forefront. Most prominent are cherries, candied raisins, and a bit of something else sweet, dried apricots maybe. Underneath I notice more typical bourbon flavors - vanilla, caramel, rye spice, burnt brown sugar, and just a tiny bit of seasoned oak. It has a bit of an herbal/floral quality to it as well. Rolling it around in my mouth I notice other subtle elements that I can’t quite put my finger on.","Crisp and clean, with a bit of rye spice popping at the onset. As it fades the taste of sweet cherries balances nicely with seasoned oak and plums. It’s short to medium length, but what’s present is pleasing.","The solera aging process is nothing new, though Hillrock is the first to apply it to the production of bourbon. You might wonder how they got around the strict requirements to label this bourbon, as bourbon has to be aged in new charred oak containers, among other requirements. Unless they’ve figured out a more creative workaround, the new distillate would have to enter new charred oak barrels first, however since this is not labelled “straight bourbon” the time spent in these barrels could be relatively short. From there the process gets even more complicated; according to a Whisky Advocate post, Hillrock uses seven different barrel sizes, and as for the the source of the older stock - “don’t bother asking; they weren’t talking.”

When a unique curation process is involved I always hope for a unique flavor profile. Hillrock delivers one here, albeit in a very subtle way. I’ve read a range of other reviews of this bourbon and it seems that its flavor profile has been a mutation since first released in 2012. Because the solera blend changes over time, the average age and underlying flavor characteristics of the blend change as well. Presumably, the percentage of older sourced bourbon has diminished over time, being replaced with a higher percentage of Hillrock’s farm-to-bottle distillate unless additional sourced bourbon has been re-introduced at some point (which is unknown).

Over time, the solera process is intended to yield a consistent final product, marrying the characteristics of young and old while also diminishing the impact of the occasional batch that doesn’t quite fit the desired flavor profile... all while asymptotically converging on a higher average age. In other words, if they stick to the same solera aging process long enough, though the average age continues to increase, these incremental increases eventually become so small that they reach a point where the change in average age is relatively insignificant from batch to batch. Because the average age cannot be measured precisely it has to be estimated, with Hillrock estimating theirs at around six years (currently).","I’ve gazed longingly at this bourbon on the liquor store shelf for a few years now. I’ve picked up the beautifully heavy bottle and felt its weight in my hands, contemplating the nearly one hundred dollars I would have to trade to make it my own. But I’ve always returned it to the shelf. Something about an always available, potentially disappointing craft bourbon at this price, even with its unique aging process, has kept me from physically carrying it up to the cash register and doing the deed. The bottle in review: A Christmas gift.

Fortunately it hasn’t disappointed me. Much like my experience with Sazerac 18 Year Rye, I’ve found this whiskey to be one that requires a bit of focus when sipping along with a more experienced palate to fully appreciate. It’s delicate, layered, and quite subtle in its delivery. As a result, it’s one of those whiskeys whose wonderful subtleties might be easily drowned out within a flight of more robust whiskeys or alongside a spread of food. Moreover, this shouldn’t be one of your first purchases - I’d suggest experiencing a wide range of other bourbons before forking over almost a Benjamin for this one.

Because this bourbon is so expensive, it’s also easily obtainable. Hillrock operates on a small scale with what seems to be a focus on quality versus quantity and the process of solera aging is certainly more involved than a typical aging process. Whatever they’re doing must be working, because while I plan to consume this sparingly, for me it passes the ultimate test - when this bottle is finished, I’ll be buying another.","Hillrock Estate Distillery Solera Aged Bourbon is a wonderfully complex yet delicate bourbon that offers a rich experience in every aspect of its delivery, including its price tag.","While Hillrock is no longer the only company offering a solera aged bourbon, it is still one of the few and will always be the original. What’s in the bottle is quite good, offering a delicate and complex, yet incredibly subtle bourbon that will be enjoyable for more experienced enthusiasts willing to take their time with it. At $90, it’s unlikely to become anyone’s daily drinker, though I doubt those who can appreciate a subtle, yet complex bourbon and who are willing to spend this amount of money on something a little different would regret the purchase. As their solera matures through many more years of permutations, I can only imagine the resulting bourbon will become even better.",Nick,2.5,4,3,4,2.5,3.5,https://www.breakingbourbon.com/review/hillrock-estate-solera-aged-bourbon
,I.W. Harper 15 Year,Classification: Straight Bourbon,Company: Diageo/I.W. Harper Distilling Co.,Distillery: New Bernheim Distillery,Released: March 2015 / Ongoing,Proof: 86,Age: 15 Years,"Mashbill: 86% Corn, 6% Rye, 8% Malted Barley",Color:  Mahogany,MSRP: $75 (2016),Official Website,"I.W. Harper is a brand that has been around in some form since 1872. Originally launched by Isaac Wolfe Bernheim, the brand is now owned and operated by Diageo. While the brand has been sold since 1872, it hasn’t been sold in the US for the last 20+ years, instead only being offered in the international marketplace during this time. Diageo choose to bring it back to the domestic marketplace in 2015, both as a NAS bourbon and a 15 year age stated bourbon.

It was distilled at the New Bernheim Distillery, aged in Stitzel-Weller Distillery warehouses, and bottled at Diageo’s Tullahoma, Tennessee facility.","Bright and enjoyable thanks to an abundance of fruit notes. Cherry and apricot are the most striking, with orange and lemon coming across a bit fainter. Mint and dark chocolate inhabit deeper layers that become more apparent as the fruit scents dissipate. Swirling the bourbon in the glass stimulates the aromas much more so than I’ve noted in other bourbons. This is evenly layered for a 15 year old bourbon, and one that’s hard to find obvious flaws in.","Not quite the striking fruit-forward palate that the nose lead me to believe, but fruit is still very much present. The milder fruit flavors dissipate and give way to heavier notes of oak and leather. Chocolate and caramel also pop up and help provide a nice balance between the sweet and dry notes. It’s smooth creamy mouthfeel helps the sweeter flavors coat your mouth until the finish kicks in.",It begins with a manageable amount of heat that soon gives way to an oaky underbelly. The bourbon’s mouthfeel helps the palate’s flavors slowly pull back one by one as the finish slowly fades. New notes of vanilla and caramel become more noticeable and a mild oaky aftertaste lingers on the finish. This combination provides a gratifying sweet and dry ending.,"The first time I had I.W. Harper 15 Year, all I could notice was its fruit flavors and it immediately brought to mind Barterhouse, another Diageo product I enjoy. After having it a few more times, I began to notice its oak side much more. The two bourbons share many similarities, mainly their modest oak notes compared with their noticeable sweet fruit-forwardness. This is especially noteworthy since both products are high-aged bourbons and often the fruit flavors fade the longer a bourbon is aged.

The growing consensus with bourbon drinkers is that they desire higher aged and premium priced bourbons to be higher in proof. It would be easy to pick on this bourbon for only being 86 proof, except in this case, it’s definitely one of the more robust 86 proof bourbons on the market. At a higher proof, there’s a good chance the oak notes would have an unhealthy effect on the bourbon’s overall palate. As is, the flavors find a happy equilibrium with one another and surprisingly don’t come across as weak - a rare feat for any sub-90 proof bourbon.","Diageo is one of the few companies that continuously releases high-aged bourbons and has maintained a consistent pricing structure with them over the past few years. If you ignore for a moment whether or not you personally like these bourbons and look at them at face value based strictly on their age statements, they’ve all been reasonably priced when compared with other companies’ high-aged bourbons.

Comparing I.W. Harper 15 Year to other Diageo bourbons, its MSRP of $75 may be a bit higher than Forged Oak’s $55 (also a 15 year old bourbon), but it’s I.W. Harper’s higher quality that makes it a better overall value comparatively. Having the same price and similar flavor profile as Barterhouse (a 20 year old bourbon) doesn’t necessarily make it any better or worse of a value simply because of their differences in age. In this comparison, age is really only a number since they share so many similarities. The simple fact is, there are far more companies selling similar aged bourbons for more money and many of them pale in comparison. I.W. Harper 15 Year is one of Diageo’s better sourced bourbons and because of its age statement, it can confidently command its premium price. If you also make note that many stores are selling this below MSRP, it’s an even better value.","A surprising flavor kick for a 15 year, 86 proof bourbon that nicely balances its sweet fruity notes with just enough oaky ones to produce a satisfying pour.","I.W. Harper 15 Year appeared like yet another high-aged bourbon from Diageo that would probably be underproofed, over-filtered, and heavily oaked. To my surprise, it’s none of these. It’s well balanced and packs a nice layered and flavorful punch for being 86 proof. It’s not overly memorable, but it’s certainly an enjoyable pour and overall of rewarding quality. There is of course the question that if it didn’t have its age statement, could it command its MSRP based solely on its taste? For most, I.W. Harper 15 Year will probably be in the “I like it” category, followed by a “it costs too much” conclusion. The value of an age statement is ultimately in the eye of the beholder, but there is one thing most will agree on with I.W. Harper 15 Year, it definitely comes in a killer bottle.",Eric,3.5,3.5,3,3,3,3.5,https://www.breakingbourbon.com/review/i-w-harper-15-year
,Jefferson's Ocean Aged at Sea Voyage 4,Classification: Straight Bourbon,Company: Jefferson's,Distillery: Sourced,Released: January 2015,Proof: 90,Age: NAS,Mashbill: Undisclosed,Color:  Pale Gold,MSRP: $85 (2015),Official Website,"This is Jefferson’s 4th ocean-aged bourbon release. The mashbill for this release is 25-30% rye, the bourbon is sourced from an undisclosed distillery(ies) in Kentucky, and is said to be about 6-7 years old. Jefferson’s has finished aging the bourbon for this 4th voyage in a specially-outfitted shipping container allowing for better airflow for an estimated 5-10 months at sea, similar to voyages 2 and forward. By contract, the shipping container the barrels were placed in for their sea voyage must be kept on the top layer at the bow of the ship to ensure direct sunlight in order to afford the opportunity for more significant temperature changes during the time at sea.

If you have a bottle of Ocean bourbon and are not sure which voyage it is here’s a quick reference: Ocean 1 was a ~600 bottle release with a sticker front label - it is the only release with a sticker label and the only voyage that was new fill and aged almost entirely at sea. Ocean 2 has a screen printed label and a batch # and bottle # on the bottleneck; it also does not say “Kentucky” on the front label because it was sourced from Indiana. Ocean 3 forward have screen printed labels with “Kentucky” on the front label, but more notably they actually state “Voyage #” on the bottleneck indicating exactly which voyage it is.

Be sure to check out: Ocean 2 Review, Ocean 3 Review, and Q&A with Trey Zoeller.",Vanilla and raisins are complemented by dry wood. It’s similar to Ocean 3 but with added dryness and a little more tingle in the nostrils.,"Sweet, spicy, and bitter flavors compete seemingly all at once. Traditional flavors of caramel and vanilla are balanced with manageable amounts of raisins and citrus. Not as thick of a mouthfeel as Ocean 2 and more complex than Ocean 3.","Rye spice takes over at first, but dissipates quickly. Traces of vanilla, raisins, and dry wood remain. It turns somewhat bitter here at first but not overly so. Brown sugar also lingers on the taste buds rounding out the bitterness making for a sweet, medium-length finish.","As we’ve recently learned the mashbill for this release (25-30% rye) is different than Ocean 1 (20% rye) and Ocean 2 (around 33% rye). We’re told that future voyages will be the same mashbill as this one. The bourbon loaded onto ships for this voyage was around 6-7 years old before its sea voyage and was distilled in Kentucky, as compared with Ocean 2 out of Indiana. The bitterness and dry wood elements I noticed in Ocean 4 provide more substantial evidence of what a sea voyage might do to bourbon than the flavor characteristics I found in Ocean 3. Where Ocean 3 provided a more heavy-handed dose of sweetness and raisins, Ocean 4 shares the same underlying characteristics but delivers them in a more balanced and complex sip.","In the enthusiast community you’ll find a wide range of opinions on Jefferson’s, Trey Zoeller, and this whole concept. Love it, hate it, that’s your opinion and a range of opinions, especially strong opinions, makes for more interesting discussion. I’ll describe my own opinion as open, curious, and skeptical. But let’s be clear about one thing, no matter what your take - this is an experiment and you’re paying a premium to taste the results of this experiment. You can find equal, better, older, or more balanced bourbons for a lot less money.

But alas, we’re bourbon geeks and really like the experimental side of things, as evidenced by our Bourbon Storage Experiment and more experiments we have in the works. We’ve purchased and reviewed Ocean 2, 3, and now 4 because we’re just that curious and a lot of readers have asked us to review this rendition. To that end, we’d been growing increasingly frustrated with Jefferson’s lack of publicized details on these releases, so we reached out to them with a list of fairly pointed questions. We were happy that Trey Zoeller, Jefferson's founder and master blender, responded to us with some details we couldn't find anywhere else. The full Q&A with Trey can be found here.We hope Jefferson's recognizes the community would prefer more information about what goes into making this Ocean bourbon and provides us with it. Knowing more about this actually increases this bourbon's value in my opinion.

So all in, you’re getting a 6-7 year-old Kentucky sourced bourbon, possibly with a similar mashbill and age as something else on the shelf for a fraction of the price… however, you’re also enjoying the opportunity to taste the results of this aged-at-sea experiment. There’s cost to transport these barrels and load them onto ships. No other company is aging bourbon at sea. If you’re ok with this then go for it, you’re not going to find any other options that fit this bill. What you’ll find in the bottle is good bourbon, just not any better than some bourbons you can find for a fraction of the price. But isn’t that true of many of the higher priced options anyway? [1]","A better end result than Ocean 3, but still a premium price to sample the results of this ocean-aging experiment. Although we have now learned more about this ocean-aging experiment, we hope there are more details yet to come.","For the premium price and lack of information at the time I was disappointed with Ocean 3 and had sworn off this line altogether. However, we received a good number of requests for this review so we decided to split a bottle of Ocean 4 among the three of us Breaking Bourbon guys. When I first opened it to split it up, I had a taste - my initial take was that it was way too bitter, I almost hated it. The inquiry I wrote to Jefferson’s was written at that time, to give you an idea where my head was at when I wrote it. Then, life happened and my one-third fill bottle sat for almost two months untouched.

When I finally sat down to write this review I was surprised by how much the bitterness had dissipated. [2] Instead I found similar flavor characteristics as Ocean 3, just with some added spice, dryness, and yes, some bitterness remained but almost in a good way - it rounded out the sweet characteristics. I poured a flight of Ocean 2, 3, and 4 in order to get a direct comparison, and was surprised how well Ocean 4 stacked up considering my initial distaste for it. In order of personal preference, I would rank them Ocean 2, then Ocean 4, and finally Ocean 3. Seeing as how Ocean 2 has the most unique flavor profile, I would say it’s the most polarizing of the three. Ocean 4 is less polarizing than Ocean 2, more complex than Ocean 3, and consequently I would say has the most widespread appeal of the three. I just happen to enjoy the richness and thick mouthfeel of Ocean 2 the best.

[1] To make things more interesting, we suggested that Jefferson’s release a 375 ml 2-pack with the before and after ocean-aging bourbons, to let us compare the two. We want to get right down to it and taste what the ocean-aging difference really is. Isn’t that what this experiment is all about? If you think this is a good idea, please contact Jefferson’s to show your support of it.

[2] The 6 month tasting results of our Bourbon Storage Experimentprovided clear evidence that allowing a bourbon to “air out” (letting it sit in less than full fill in a sealed container) for a bit can actually improve taste, as some of you have probably experienced. This is a great example of a bourbon that got better after the bottle had been allowed to sit at about one-third fill for a while.",Nick,2.5,3.5,3,3.5,2,3.5,https://www.breakingbourbon.com/review/jeffersons-ocean-aged-at-sea-voyage-4
In Depth Review,"Jefferson's Ocean Aged at Sea: Voyage 15 ""Special Wheated Mash Bill""",Classification: Straight Bourbon,Company: Jefferson's,Distillery: Undisclosed,Released: June 2018,Proof: 90,Age: NAS,Mashbill: Undisclosed (Wheated),Color:  Dark Gold,MSRP: $80 (2018),Official Website,"Jefferson’s Ocean Aged at Sea series was created as an experiment to see how much of an impact aging barrels on a ship would have on a bourbon. According to the company, “each voyage of Jefferson’s Ocean typically crosses the equator four times, visits five continents and over 30 ports on an average sailing.” The first Voyage release of Jefferson’s Ocean Aged at Sea was comprised of only three barrels. After 14 subsequent releases, one of which included a cask strength version, Voyage 15 is the first labeled as a “Special Wheated Mash Bill.”","Noticeably light, this bourbon’s nose arrives on a whisper. Butterscotch and vanilla dominate with a slight burst of caramel and youthful oak on the tailend. Its sweetness is dominant despite its overall thinness. There are only generic bourbon flavors on display, which struggle to be memorable.","A thin yet oily mouthfeel delivers big oak on first sip. Clove, pepper, grain, and burnt caramel join the fray, producing an interesting interplay of flavors. I can’t say I’ve had many bourbons that taste in the same wheelhouse as this one. Sure some may include similar flavors, but it’s the exchange of the flavors that make this particular palate unique causing me to take notice.","Seasoned oak, allspice, wet cedar, dill, pecans, and fresh sourdough make up this peculiar finish. Slight heat and an almost phantom-like hint of cinnamon develops in the tailend. Like the palate, there is a lot going on in the finish, and while it doesn’t all blend together perfectly, it’s rather intriguing and makes me want to drink more.","Aging bourbon on a boat is pretty high up there on the uniqueness scale, but after 15 Voyages, some of which were quite lackluster, can that still be said? After five years, no company has copied Zoeller and released their own “Aged at Sea” variation, so in a way the Ocean series is still quite unique. It could also mean no one thinks very much of the series, because if there is money to be made from this concept, someone would have copied it by now.

The first two Ocean releases were quite unique tasting, the problem was the next few weren’t, and the concept began to sink under its own weight. After taking some time off from the series,  I gave it another chance and was pleasantly surprised by the unique elements the Ocean series brought to the sip. Directly comparing it to the standard Jefferson’s Small Batch Bourbon, the difference is night and day. The same is true with Voyage 15. This isn’t a standard Jefferson’s, nor does it taste like a typical wheated bourbon. It’s its own unique beast and a better product because of it.","The Jefferson’s Ocean series has always had a hard time justifying its premium price tag. Since Voyage 2 was released in 2014 for $70, the bourbon pricing landscape has drastically changed, yet this series’ pricing hasn’t. In some cases the price has even decreased depending on where you look, all while becoming a better product in the process. It’s still not an inexpensive product, but it has somewhat grown into its price point in 2018. Sure I would much rather see this in the $60-$70 range, but at $80 it comes down to whether the specific release can justify it or not.

Voyage 15 is a curious bourbon because it brings a lot of interesting aspects to the table. It’s easy to want a higher proof, yet its 90 proof is pitch perfect for what it does. It allows its many flavors to keep from overpowering one another and instead gives them room to breathe. $80 is a lot for any bourbon and even though this isn’t an amazing bourbon, it has enough interesting aspects to warrant a premium price tag. Simply it's hard to find something this fascinated in a bourbon priced much below this.",This asking-to-be-called-a-gimmick bourbon series has somehow defied expectations and slowly morphed into an exciting and unique tasting proof of concept.,"Being a wheated bourbon I thought I knew what to expect. Boy was I wrong. We’ll never know for sure how much the aging on a ship actually did to the original bourbon, but I can say that this is one of the more unique tasting wheated bourbons as of late. I had a similar tasting experience with Voyage 12, as that bourbon also sported a very unique tasting element that I haven't experienced with another bourbon.
After 15 Voyages, Jefferson’s Ocean Aged at Sea must be a commercial success otherwise it would seem Zoeller would be hard-pressed to continually spend the extra capital it takes to age barrels of bourbon at sea. What can easily be seen as a gimmick to some, in my experience, has resulted in some of the most unique tasting bourbons I've had in the last few years. Unique doesn’t always mean amazing, but it often results in a bourbon that piques my interest. When I go to my shelf for a pour, in an endless sea of like-tasting bourbons, it’s often the one-of-a-kind tasting bourbons that win out. If the last few Voyages are any indication of the type of products that Zoeller has turned the series into, I say “All aboard.”",Eric,2.5,3.5,3,4.5,2.5,3.5,https://www.breakingbourbon.com/review/jeffersons-ocean-aged-at-sea-voyage-15-special-wheated-mash-bill
,Joseph Magnus Bourbon,Classification: Straight Bourbon Finished in Sherry and Cognac Casks,Company: Jos. A. Magnus & Co.,Distillery: Sourced (from an undisclosed distillery in Indiana),Release Date: Ongoing,Proof: 100,Age: NAS (Website states 12 years old),Mashbill: Undisclosed,Color: Bronze,MSRP: $80,Official Website,"Jos. A. Magnus & Co. is the second coming of the Magnus brand. Originally started by Joseph A. Magnus in 1892, the company focused on producing whiskey until Prohibition took hold. Afterwards, the brand was revitalized when Joseph Magnus’ great grandson discovered a few unopened bottles bearing the family namesake. Re-established in 2015, the company now focuses on blending and finishing techniques initially employed by Joseph Magnus.

Today, Joseph Magnus is stated to be a bourbon that is as close as possible to the original Joseph Magnus Bourbon initially discovered by his great grandson. The bourbon is a straight bourbon whiskey that is triple cask finished in Oloroso sherry, Pedro Ximénez sherry, and cognac casks. The bottle being reviewed is 490/892.","Expressive and enticing, the nose starts off with scents of orange rind drizzled with light honey, along with a rush of ripe plums and other dark fruits. Diving in deeper reveals hints of buttercream frosted cake, light leather, and the slightest hint of ethanol. The triple cask finish is apparent, as the mingling of scents is unique yet distinguished, providing a thought-provoking complexity and a great way to open the sip.","The sip starts with sweeter notes of cherry pie filling, vanilla and brown sugar. Dark fruits pop behind and help bridge the transition to drier notes of oak and leather. The fact that this bourbon touched four different barrels seems to be more prominent here, as the drier notes become more dominating the longer you swirl the sip around in your mouth. While the delivery may not quite live up to what the nose teased, it comes pretty close.","The drier flavors from the palate slide into the finish to round things out. Green peppercorn, oak, leather, and a hint of tobacco leaf immediately pop. These morph into a lingering dry oak with a slight hint of medicinal cherry similar to a HALLS cough drop. It’s a ho-hum way to end the sip after the expressive nose and palate that preceded.","Barrel finished whiskey isn’t a unique concept by any means. Most often companies will use a single type of barrel to finish a whiskey, with used wine casks being the most common finishing barrel type. Sometimes they want to try to distinguish themselves further from the crowd using an unusual finishing cask, such as what Willett did using Curacao Casks for their XCF. Other times they’re looking to continue to age the whiskey, but in a different barrel, such as what Barton did with 1792 Port Finish. Finishing in a second American oak barrel is also quite common, and brands such as Woodford Double Oak also make it a part of their identity.

Moving deeper into the world of barrel finishes, you sometimes see companies use two different barrels to finish their bourbon, such as Woodford Double Double Oak, or reuse a barrel to age multiple different types of whiskeys such as what High West has done with some of their single barrel selections. However, what you don’t see too often is a company using three separate types of barrels to barrel finish a whiskey. This is the characteristic that helps Joseph Magnus distinguish itself.

Triple barrel finishing is more of a novel concept given its rarity, likely because of how difficult to pull off successfully. While Jos. A. Magnus & Co. doesn’t state how long the whiskey sits in each type of cask before moving on to the next, the end result is that this bourbon has touched the wood of four distinct barrels by the time all is said and done. The sherry and cognac casks in this case impart some richer flavors that you don’t tend to see in barrel finished whiskeys only using one finishing barrel. However, utilizing so many barrels also adds depth to the drier flavors present, which are constantly battling to take center stage. No matter how you cut it though, you have to give Jos. A. Magnus & Co. credit for taking the time to finish this in three distinct casks, as not only is that a labor of love, but it also gives greater insight into how far you can push barrel finishing a whiskey without going overboard.","Besides age, there are two other things that can quickly increase the price of a bourbon: if it is sourced, and if a secondary barrel finish is involved. In this case not only is Joseph Magnus sourced, it also has to contend with the fact that three distinct casks are used to finish this bourbon. Knowing this, I’m actually surprised at its price point.

In order to utilize a triple barrel finish, Jos. A. Magnus & Co. has to procure the barrels plus manually transfer the bourbon from cask to cask. Whether the bourbon sits in it for one hour, one day, or longer, the fact remains that someone still has to manually move this whiskey from cask to cask, and that comes at a cost of time and manpower.

Now of course the effort has to be worth the outcome in order to justify the price. Joseph Magnus may not be as memorable as some other barrel finished whiskeys that have come before it that really focus on the secondary barrel imparting a strong flavor, such as Angel’s Envy Rye, for instance. That said, Joseph Magnus’ sip is still nuanced enough to be appreciable, and it is this marriage of flavors from numerous barrel finishes that imparts layers of subtle nuances without taking it too far. It’s a more than fair price to pay for the process it endured to get here, and the end result that backs it up.","What may come across as a mad science experiment in regards to barrel finishing, turns out to be just the right formula in the case of Joseph Magnus bourbon.","Joseph Magnus is always going to be a polarizing bottle to many who walk past it on a store shelf simply because it’s a barrel finished bourbon. Seeing that Joseph Magnus is finished in three unique barrels won’t help its case with these consumers. Additionally, a higher price tag for a NAS sourced bourbon is also a tough pill for many to swallow. However, after having the chance to really dive into this finished bourbon, I say to those individuals, it’s worth your time and money to give it a fair shake.

Even with the finish falling short, the bourbon delivers a diverse and nuanced sip thanks to a solid nose and palate. Surprisingly, even with its utilization of three distinct casks in finishing, no individual barrel influence is too overpowering. Instead, Joseph Magnus delivers a sip that is clearly influenced by the barrels it touched, yet one that can still be appreciated by bourbon drinkers who may not normally reach for a barrel finished bourbon.

,Joseph Magnus Cigar Blend Bourbon - Batch 24 “The Fruit Bomb”,"Classification: Straight Bourbon Finished in Armagnac, Sherry, and Cognac Casks",Company: Jos. A. Magnus & Co.,Distillery: Sourced (from undisclosed distillery[ies] in Indiana),Release Date: Ongoing,Proof: 124,"Age: NAS (Website states a blend of Joseph Magnus Bourbon and an 18 year old bourbon, which is then finished in Armagnac casks)",Mashbill: Undisclosed,Color: Mahogany,MSRP: $175 (2020),Official Website,"Jos. A. Magnus & Co. is the second iteration of the Magnus brand. Originally started by Joseph A. Magnus in 1892, the company focused on producing whiskey until Prohibition took hold. Afterwards, the brand was revitalized when Joseph Magnus’ great grandson discovered a few unopened bottles bearing the family namesake. Re-established in 2015, the company now focuses on blending and finishing techniques initially employed by Joseph Magnus.

Joseph Magnus Cigar Blend Bourbon was developed by Nancy Fraley, a Master Blender and widely revered whiskey and rum consultant. The finished bourbon was created with the intent of pairing it with a cigar, notably including Armagnac, Sherry, and Cognac finishing - three spirits known to pair well with cigars. It is a very small batch product, with the bottle in review being bottle 360/373 from Batch 24.","Rich dark tobacco notes pair with baking spices and seasoned oak. A swirl of the glass reveals clove, dark roast coffee, and dried dark fruit notes. A slight nuttiness is present but fleeting. The proof makes itself known with an ample amount of heat, but it doesn’t overpower the other scents. Overall it’s rich and intriguing, inviting you in for more.","The sip hits with a potent punch of flavors. Clove, tobacco, and seasoned oak form a foundation. These flavors combine with a robust mix of spice, with rye and baking spices being the most prominent. Dark berries mingle in, offering a slightly sweet addition to the sip. Complex and savory overall, the palate is quite robust and enjoyable.","The finish immediately shifts to becoming quite dry, offering trailing flavors of cocoa and tobacco amidst a leather note. Charred oak and leather taper in, but it remains savory versus sweet in overall delivery. Long and complex, it’s a suiting pairing for the nose and palate that precede it.","Cigar Blend starts with a base of high aged whiskeys ranging in age from about 11 to 18 years old. Joseph Magnus Cigar Blend includes the standard Joseph Magnus bourbon which is triple cask finished in Armagnac, Sherry, and Cognac casks, adds an additional high rye (36%) bourbon, and then finishes the entire blend again in Armagnac casks. This product is curated by Nancy Fraley, one of the industry’s most highly respected Master Blenders. The flavor profile varies from batch to batch, but the company’s ultimate goal is to create a blend that pairs well with a cigar.

Batch 24 succeeds in reaching that goal, with a savory, almost tobacco-inspired sip. The combination of various finishes combined with a high 124 proof, creates a robust and complex bourbon that offers an unusual flavor profile, but doesn’t veer too far from still maintaining a “bourbon” backbone. The resulting combination of flavors and finishes is unusual in the industry, and such a unique finish and blend is rarely attempted with such high aged bourbons.","I have yet to see Joseph Magnus bourbons on the shelves locally, and because batches of Cigar Blend are so small, I have rarely seen it online either. Its asking price of $175 is unexpected, but at the same time not entirely surprising. Given its relatively high age, multiple barrel finishes, and insanely small batches, this ongoing release product is also very limited. Batch 24 is particularly suited to cigar pairing, and I would assume other batches are as well. In that regard, it’s a limited release with a unique and developed flavor profile that I can understand how some could become enamored with.

However, such small batches combined with a high price tag will not be worth the risk for many. This whiskey maintains its bourbon backbone, but does deviate quite significantly from a traditional bourbon flavor profile. The company website also does a poor job of distinguishing batch to batch qualities and flavor profile for consumers burying them in their blog (hint hint Jos. A. Magnus & Co.), which I believe is important for such a high cost brand that seems to have an incredible amount of thought and effort put into each batch. To that end, the price is steep for a bourbon you don’t quite know what you are going to get, though the effort is there and the flavor profile is going to be unabashedly unique.","Joseph Magnus Cigar Blend Bourbon is a high end finished blend that achieves what it sets out to, but comes in at a steep price and significant variation from batch to batch.","Joseph Magnus Cigar Blend is a really good bourbon. It offers a barrage of unique traits which culminate nicely into a unique flavor profile that, at least with Batch 24, seems to accomplish exactly what the company sets out to do. Unfortunately, the company’s website and marketing information do little to showcase this bourbon, and as a result miss the opportunity to better educate consumers on this intriguing product. I feel a lot could be gained by sharing more information about the creation of this product and batch variation more readily with consumers, and of course making it easy to find! While I can easily say I like the batch reviewed, it is somewhat difficult to recommend a future batch at such a high price and with such a drastic difference in flavor profile from batch to batch. An expensive risk that could go either way.",Nick,3.5,4,3,4,2,3.5,https://www.breakingbourbon.com/review/joseph-magnus-cigar-blend-bourbon-batch-24-the-fruit-bomb
,Kentucky Owl Rye Batch 01,Classification: Straight Rye,Company: Stoli Group,Distillery: Sourced,Released: September 2017,Proof: 110.6,Age: 11 Years,Mashbill: Undisclosed,Color:  Dark Copper,MSRP: $130 (2017),Official Website,"Kentucky Owl Rye Batch 1 is the company’s first foray into rye. Kentucky Owl is well known for their extremely limited run bourbon releases which have ranged from 194 to 2,535 bottles per release. Unlike their bourbon releases, Kentucky Owl hasn’t disclosed how many barrels were used in this release or how bottles were introduced to the market. It is rumored, however, that there are 7,000+ bottles in this release. This release is limited to half the country, including California, Colorado, the District of Columbia, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia, Washington, and Wisconsin.

As a brand, Kentucky Owl was recently purchased by the Stoli Group who plans to open up a new distillery under this brand name.","A classic undertone of rye spice dominates the nose. It’s joined by green apple, fresh pine needles, pie crust, and hints of vanilla and oak. For 110.6 proof, it’s surprising to see how nonexistent the ethanol scent is. Its aromas come off as delicate but also well defined.","Big doses of rye spice come into frame, along with the fruit that carries through from the nose. Additional hints of vanilla and oak are also present. The palate starts off sweet, but morphs towards a drier profile after coating the mouth. It’s easy to hold the whiskey in your mouth and pick apart the flavors due in large part to the absence of any burn. If I didn’t know any better, I would have pegged this closer to 100 proof. Really pleasing and delicious.","Dry overall with oak and rye dominating the beginning of the finish. The heat ramps up a few seconds into the finish and this is where the rye finally shows its proof. It’s fleeting though, as it dies down quickly giving way to a mixture of rye, pine, a light pepper mixture, leather, nutmeg, and cigar box. The finish eventually slims down to a heavy dose of pine and rye which lingers for a long time. It’s okay, and clearly the weakest part of the overall flavor profile.","Aged ryes are a rarity in today’s marketplace. Even rarer are ryes aged over 10 years old. After you add in the fact that this is high proof, Kentucky Owl has all of the pieces of a unique marketplace offering going for it. That is until you start to compare it to what else is out there.

My first comparison was to a 7 year old Redemption Rye Barrel Proof bottle, and I quickly realized that this wasn’t an apples to apples comparison. The Redemption Rye had a unique MGP rye flavor profile which didn't align with this Kentucky Owl release. My second comparison proved to be a much better rival to the Owl in the form of Pikesville 6 Year Rye Whiskey. Even though Pikesville is 5 years younger, it’s almost the exact same proof and is also a Kentucky distilled rye just like Kentucky Owl. The Pikesville contained a bolder flavor compared to the Owl, which I found it to be more exciting and refreshing.

That’s the crux with this Kentucky Owl release: its flavor profile for the most part is well rounded and easy to like, however it’s not a lot different than other ryes in the marketplace. Age may help it stand out, but doesn’t necessarily help it differentiate itself from other competitors when it comes down to flavor profile.","There’s no beating around the bush on this price tag. Plain and simple, this is overpriced. Even in today’s marketplace, a $130 bottle needs to hold up and really shine through in order to be able to justify the price. Though its flavor profile delivers the goods, it’s still hard to justify the price considering you can buy two bottles of Pikesville 6 year rye with money to spare. Honestly, a more appropriate and fair price for this release would be right around $100.","Easy to enjoy, yet hard to justify in price, Kentucky Owl Rye is a release that will leave you scratching your head when you compare it to other ryes at a far lower price point.","Kentucky Owl presents quite the conundrum. The nose and the palate are quite delicious, while the finish is just hohum. Add in the fact that it’s overpriced and doesn’t stand out compared to its competitors it leaves me wondering: “Would I tell someone not to buy a bottle of this?” I can’t say I would. The fact of the matter is, it’s a good rye.

When I first tasted Kentucky Owl by itself, I found it to be fantastic. It wasn't until I started tasting it against other great ryes, that its flaws came to light including its finish and overall value. At the end of the day however, while it’s not an all time great bottle, it is still one of the better ryes on the market right now. Being that it’s 11 years old and tends to drink lower than its 110.6 proof, you still have a winning combination that many will really enjoy.",Jordan,3.5,4,2.5,3,2,3.5,https://www.breakingbourbon.com/review/kentucky-owl-rye-batch-01
,Kentucky Owl Rye Batch 02,Classification: Straight Rye,Company: Stoli Group,Distillery: Sourced (from undisclosed distillery[ies] in Kentucky),Released: June 2018,Proof: 101.8,Age: 11 Years,Mashbill: Undisclosed,Color:  Copper,MSRP: $200 (2018),Official Website,"Kentucky Owl Bourbon was founded in 1879 by C.M. Dedman and is currently led by Dixon Dedman. He recommissioned the brand and released his first batch of bourbon in 2014 and first batch of rye in 2017. The Kentucky Owl brand was purchased by the Stoli Group who plans to open up a new distillery under this brand name.

Rye Batch 2 has a smaller batch volume than Batch 1. It was released in June 2018 to the following markets: Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, District of Columbia, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Virginia, Washington, Wisconsin, and Wyoming.","A medium intensity scent billows out of the glass and lures you in with its welcoming aromas. A dessert bakery bouquet of vanilla, custard, caramel, buttercream frosting, and nutmeg. Pleasing and hard to resist.","The dessert bakery theme continues into the palate as toffee, caramel, and vanilla flavors come into focus. Milder notes of cherry, cinnamon, and rye spice are present, but don’t overpower adding a nice layer of depth. It’s a crowd pleaser of flavors that are made smoother thanks to its proof.","The sweeter notes drop off leaving a medium dry, slightly spicy aftertaste. Cinnamon notes and its overall hotness ramp up against a backdrop of leather, burnt caramel, and oak. It’s a nice counter to the sweeter and softer side of the whiskey and reminds the drinker that at its core, this is a rye whiskey.","There are a lot of ryes on the market thanks to its resurgence in popularity in recent years. Many, unfortunately, don’t stand out from the masses as most tend to blend together. Some of this has to do with many of them originating from the same distillery (MGP Ingredients), while some is due to simply rushing products to the market. Despite constantly being told rye can be better young, in reality, it’s often the old ryes that are the most memorable and sport the most character.

Both Kentucky Owl Rye Batch 1 and Batch 2 are excellent examples of this. They have more depth and complexity than you get from a typical rye. Batch 1 is 9 proof points higher than Batch 2, and tastes like it. I prefer it to Batch 2, but it certainly isn’t as drinkable. It will largely depend on who you’re drinking with and the mood you’re in, but each Batch is memorable in its own way. They still very much straddle what traditional rye tastes like, but are better constructed and more developed than the average rye.","Kentucky Owl states in their press release that they “...crafted this straight rye whiskey to be more approachable to the casual drinker, while containing all the good parts of whiskey without any of the bad.” While that statement is somewhat laughable since what company actively tries to leave the bad in (also what does that even mean?), but the first part rings 100% true. Lowering the proof and focusing on crowd pleasing flavors makes this very drinkable for just about anyone. The rub is, if they were focusing on more casual drinkers, why the $70 price increase from Batch 1? That is the hardest part to swallow about Batch 2. While Batch 2 might not be light years ahead of products half their price, there is an incremental quality bump that they feel equals an exponential bump in price. The company did the same thing with Batch 8 of their bourbon, which saw a bump from $200 to $350. Yes Kentucky Owl Rye Batch 2 is a good whiskey, but the price jump in 9 months simply doesn’t compute.",An easy-to-drink rye with a hard-to-swallow price point.,"Like all of Kentucky Owl’s past and current products, Rye Batch 2 is sourced from one or more distilleries in Kentucky. Despite this, its age, and presumably expert selection and blending of barrels, are what has made Kentucky Owl’s rye batches stand out. I might not have been blown away by Batch 1 when I first had it last year, but it is one that I haven't gotten out of my head and something I return to whenever I can. That says a lot about Kentucky Owl’s rye batches. They’re really good and very drinkable. That was what Kentucky Owl set out for with Batch 2, and they certainly succeeded. Add to that the fact that 11 year old ryes aren’t easy to come by, and just maybe you can overlook its high price point. With a lack of readily available competitors, Kentucky Owl Batch 2 might win just by showing up.",Eric,4,3.5,3,3.5,1.5,3.5,https://www.breakingbourbon.com/review/kentucky-owl-rye-batch-02
,King of Kentucky Bourbon - 2018 Release,Classification: Straight Bourbon,Company: Brown-Forman,Distillery: Brown-Forman,Released: May 2018,Proof: 132.9,Age: 14 Years,"Mashbill: 79% Corn, 11% Rye, 10% Malted Barley",Color:  Dark Copper,MSRP: $200 (2018),Official Website,"Available only in Kentucky, King of Kentucky is a rebirth of the classic brand by Brown-Forman. The original King of Kentucky label was named in honor of horse racing, also known as the “sport of kings.” According to the company, “...this release is based on a brand of the same name that was established in 1881. Brown-Forman acquired the brand from Selected KY Distillers, Inc. in 1936, and discontinued it in 1968.”

The release is derived from 16 single barrels with an average yield of 30%, that range in proof between 125-135. Brown-Forman confirmed with us that an estimated 960 bottles will be released this year. While it hasn’t been confirmed yet, it can be assumed based on press language that this will be an ongoing release. The sample provided by Brown-Forman has no barrel designations.","This nose is full of flavor right from the get go. Baking chocolate, spiced raisins, cinnamon stick, preserved peaches, crispy baked pie crust, sweet aged leather, and an underlying hint of something else that I just can’t place my finger on. Ethanol is definitely present, but doesn’t distract from the other aromas. This nose smells delicious, especially considering the proof it’s clocking in at.","The palate allows the proof of this bourbon to shine in full force. This is a big bold bourbon that owns its proof proudly. The sip starts with a lot of heat dominating up front. Searching beyond it I find rye spice, leather, baking chocolate, white pepper, and a dab of sweetness. Even though the flavors have to fight through the intense heat for attention, they play very well together for this high proofer. While I do wish they didn’t have to fight the heat as much, this also isn’t unexpected due to the bourbon's high proof and ultimately doesn’t detract from the experience too much.","A warmth lingers in my mouth after the sip finishes. It’s immediately noticeable that the sweetness from the nose and palate are gone. The age of this bourbon becomes apparent in the predominant form of dry tannic oak and leather, which are are joined with a slight hint of green peppercorns. The finish lingers on oak and leather along with a heat that stays in your chest for a while. The finish isn’t bad by any means, but compared to the nose and palate it’s the most uneventful part of the sip.","Let’s get this out of the way, King of Kentucky will not be the best 14 year old bourbon you’ll ever taste. Far from it. There are many Willetts that are as old or older and are also single barrel barrel proof that drink better. That said, King of Kentucky is still a really good bourbon and one that is distinct in the Brown-Forman lineup as it is made up of a mashbill consistent with high aged Early Times stock

To date, this is the oldest, and with the exception of the barrels lower in proof than the 2018 Woodford Reserve Batch Proof, the highest proof bourbon released by Brown-Forman. It wears its age on its sleeve and tastes unlike other Brown-Forman bourbons. It has the umpf of Old Forester 1920 with additional heat, the richer notes found in Woodford Batch Proof, and sweeter notes found in the nose of some other Woodford products. Additionally, there are characteristics found throughout the sip that only come with time in the barrel. While a single barrel, barrel proof bourbon isn’t anything new, compared to others in the Brown-Forman portfolio King of Kentucky is as unique as they come.","King of Kentucky is Brown-Forman’s most expensive bourbon ever released. Their stated justification for the $200 price tag is that “the price reflects the rarity of the product, but allows it to be accessible to whiskey connoisseurs.” Initial gut instinct may be to roll your eyes, but having given this a lot of thought there is more to meet the eye on the price tag.

Looking at the marketplace in 2018, $200 for a limited release seems to be right in the middle of where pricing tends to be. Some releases are lower, like the artificially low priced Buffalo Trace Antique Collection, while some are higher like WhistlePig’s overpriced Dark Prince Rye. Normally I would roll my eyes at the saying that the market can justify it so it’s fine, however in comparison to other releases, $200 isn’t out of line in this specific case.

King of Kentucky is a very limited release consisting of under 1,000 bottles. If you thought the Russell’s Reserve 1998 & 2002 releases were limited releases, King of Kentucky sets the benchmark for limited non-gift shop releases from a major distillery. Considering the limited amount released, $200 isn’t completely out of line. Additionally, not only are you buying a very limited bourbon, but a very enjoyable drinking bourbon at that. I’m okay with higher pricing for limited releases when it’s justifiable and the product delivers. In this case, King of Kentucky is just under the threshold for what I would consider reasonable. Sure I can buy a bottle of Old Forester 1920 from Brown-Forman for about a third of the price, but that’s going to deliver a very different drinking experience compared to King of Kentucky.

Now in regards to the second part of that quote from Brown-Forman regarding pricing it to be accessible to all whiskey connoisseurs, that is debatable. Sure the price may be reasonable and allow many folks to buy versus pricing this at $500 or more, but when you sell a product in only one state, that makes it hard to justify it being “accessible” in the truest sense. That nitpick aside, I walk away form this review feeling that Brown-Forman actually picked a reasonable price for King of Kentucky.","There’s no gimmicks here, the return of King of Kentucky is the real deal, delivering a big bold bourbon.","King of Kentucky is a surprising new extension out of Brown-Forman. The inaugural 2018 release could have easily been a marketing ploy, à la the Orphan Barrel line, to resurrect an old brand and use high aged Early Times barrels that weren’t designated for anything specific. Instead, what Brown-Forman delivered is a really great limited edition whiskey. While priced higher than any other bourbon they’ve ever released, the price doesn’t eclipse the product itself.

My biggest complaint with this release is that its low bottle count was an easy out for Brown-Forman to justify limiting this release to only the Kentucky market. It’s a shame that others outside of Kentucky won’t get to try this without paying over inflated secondary prices. That said, if you are lucky enough to land a bottle, do yourself a favor and open it. Many will not want to open it due to its low production run, but that would be a shame. King of Kentucky is a nice showcase of what Brown-Forman can do with longer aged higher proof whiskey. Here’s hoping that this becomes a trend for them, as that would be a win for everyone.

An undercurrent of dark fruit draws attention away from the oak, providing a welcome layer of sweetness. The overall aroma leans heavily on oak and certainly supports the bourbon’s 15 year age. While some will appreciate this, others will argue the oak is a little too dominant.","An initial burst of rye spice is immediately followed by a rush of dry, seasoned oak. The dryness continues to ramp up, but as it does, sweeter flavors of raisin, caramel, and burnt brown sugar develop along with a trace of tobacco. Like the nose, the oak continues to be the dominant flavor, however not so much to completely overwhelm the other flavors present allowing for a good amount of complexity to develop.","The bourbon’s dryness crescendos in the finish, though it does allow for the sweeter flavors to continue to show through. Aged oak and caramel are offered up, with a hint of graham cracker and raisin underneath. Rye spice pops as the flavors dissipate. Overall the bourbon is consistent in its delivery from nose to palate to finish, with aged oak dominating against sweeter underlying flavors throughout.","In some ways, Knob Creek 15 Year offers exactly what you might expect it would. Aged oak dominates with sweet flavors underneath, it drinks right at its 100 proof point, and doesn’t ever quite find itself out of bounds. Unfortunately, it probably won’t knock anyone’s socks off either. It maintains a traditional Kentucky bourbon flavor profile, and leans towards dry oak in the same way older Elijah Craig releases tend to do. Given the fact that many older bourbons being released nowadays either originate from Tennessee and share a familiar flavor profile, or are just very difficult to obtain due to being limited releases, those looking for more dominant aged oak with sweet undertones don’t have a ton of options. Knob Creek 15 Year certainly delivers in that sense, offering drinkers a more traditionally flavored bourbon that shows its age.","When it comes to limited editions, Knob Creek has to fight an uphill battle they actually created themselves with respect to value. Their standard 100 proof Small Batch comes in at 9 years old (again, as the age statement was dropped and recently added back) and lists for around $35. Their standard 120 proof Single Barrel, which also comes in at least 9 years old, is easily found for only about $10 more. Additionally, single barrel selections bottled at 120 proof (like the one we did) could not only be found for around $55, they also clock in in the 10-15 year old range, making for a shockingly low priced, high-aged, and sometimes mind-blowing drinking experience.

With each of these relatively low cost, high proof, high aged, and easily above average if not much more than that standard and accessible bottlings, what exactly does a Knob Creek limited edition look like and why would consumers be interested?

Knob Creek answered that question with a roar with the recent release of Knob Creek 12 Year, a bourbon that has become a part of their standard lineup and offered at $60. Its quality and balance elevate it from the existing line of standard release bourbons, and while the 100 proof is lower than the single barrel’s 120, its balance and fullness of flavor still manages to deliver in ways the rest of the standard lineup does not. To the tidal wave of those who enjoy commenting on social media with the “why buy the 100 proof 12 Year for $60 when I can get an older 120 proof single barrel for less” argument, this comparison includes many of the private selection single barrels that just don’t offer the same level of balance and consistency found in the 12 Year.

In assessing Knob Creek 15 Year, I had hopes for the same level of greatness displayed with Knob Creek 12 Year, however I was met with an experience more in line with Knob Creek 2001 released back in 2017, a 14 year old limited edition series that consisted of multiple batches. Incidentally, the price for 2001 clocked in at $130 per bottle, and arguably why it can still be found on some retailer shelves today. Unfortunately, Knob Creek 15 Year moves so far towards oak that it doesn’t quite offer the same level of magic and balance found in 12 Year. While I certainly expect more oak given the 3 year age difference, I also hoped for the same fullness of flavor, brightness, and a nice mouthfeel. Unfortunately this is not the case, and while Knob Creek 15 Year is certainly a high quality bourbon, this comparison within the lineup cannot be ignored, and neither can its price.

However, going outside of the Knob Creek lineup reveals something different. There are a relatively high volume of 13-15 year old bourbons coming out of Tennessee, with price points ranging from around $35 for the 13 year old George Dickel Bottled in Bond to $200 for Peyton Manning’s Sweetens Cove, and many falling somewhere in between. Few releases of this age originate from Kentucky or Indiana nowadays, and when they do they can go for a lot more like Elijah Craig 18 Year with a $150 asking price, which is $50 more than Knob Creek 15 Year with only three additional years of age. Focusing on age and accepting an oak-forward flavor profile, Knob Creek’s price is certainly fair considering this broader group of higher aged bourbons.","Knob Creek 15 Year proves that a little extra time in the barrel can go a long way when it comes to amping up oak in the flavor profile, producing an oak-dominant bourbon with undercurrents of sweetness.","Knob Creek is an impressive brand, with a solid lineup that many would cite as some of the best bourbons for the money. This makes it difficult to impress fans with limited releases, and as a result, Knob Creek 15 Year faces the challenge of not only other companies’ products, but comparisons with the remainder of the Knob Creek lineup. In a way the brand is its own worst enemy.

After the fantastic recent nationwide release of Knob Creek 12 Year, I had high hopes for Knob Creek 15 Year. Unfortunately, while it isn’t a bad bourbon by any means, I found the 12 Year to be a better pour available for $40 less. Knob Creek 15 Year’s more heavy-handed oak will deliver the ideal drinking experience for some, but for others it just won’t reach the same level of greatness. Compared to Knob Creek’s already fantastic lineup, 15 Year is a hard sell considering the exceptional quality and value delivered by Knob Creek for a lot less.",Nick,3,3.5,3.5,3.5,2.5,3.5,https://www.breakingbourbon.com/review/knob-creek-15-year-2020-limited-edition
,Knob Creek Cask Strength Rye - 2018 Limited Edition,Classification: (Straight)* Rye,Company: Beam Suntory,Distillery: Jim Beam,Released: May 2018,Proof: 119.6,Age: NAS (Press materials indicate 9 years),"Mashbill: Undisclosed (Confirmed it shares the same mashbill as standard Knob Creek Rye, which is believe to be at or just slightly above the legal minimum of 51% rye)",Color:  Deep Amber,MSRP: $70 (2018),Official Website,"Knob Creek Cask Strength Rye 2018 Limited Edition was named “Best Rye Whiskey” at the 2018 San Francisco World Spirits Competition and has been met with mostly glowing reviews. This release comes alongside a new ongoing Knob Creek Single Barrel Select program, thus representing a fairly robust expansion of the Knob Creek Rye portfolio in 2018.

*This is the first Limited Edition Rye released under the Knob Creek brand. While the label does not say “straight,” Beam Suntory has confirmed with us that it is. While it does not technically have an age statement, the press materials indicate it is 9 years old. This is further substantiated by the label indicating it was barreled in 2009, however whiskey is often set aside in steel tanks after it has been dumped to prevent further aging so that is not necessary proof of age in-and-of itself. A bottle count has not been publicly released.","Sweet vanilla and honey are enveloped in warming spices with a nice intensity. If I inhale just the right way, there’s a good amount of heat that digs its way into my nostrils making it even more pronounced. This makes for a rather bold yet still quite enjoyable aroma.","Black pepper and baking spices upfront give way to sweeter flavors of brown sugar, honey, and vanilla. The higher proof is manageable and sweet flavors do well to counter the spicy pop providing balance. The mouthfeel is satisfying, but not unusually unique in any way.","It starts with a Kentucky hug, as the spicy heat fills the back of the throat and hits with a bold intensity reminding you it’s almost 120 proof. The intensity fades quickly, leaving baking spices and charred oak against brown sugar and honey. It lingers, ultimately ending on a good note.","It’s nice to see Knob Creek expanding the rye side of their lineup, as Knob Creek Rye has always been a rye I’ve enjoyed and one I’ve found most people tend to like as well. Because of its sweetness, my assumption is there is a lot of corn in the mashbill, and it this weren’t just a barely legal rye I would be surprised. The 2018 Limited Edition is the first Knob Creek Rye I’ve had that’s over 100 proof, as I have yet to try a Knob Creek Single Barrel Select Rye which clocks in at 115 proof (also released in 2018). At 9 years, the age is relatively high for a rye, which may contribute to some of its more subtle attributes, including the balance of spicy and sweet. It’s also unknown if Knob Creek will continue to release limited edition ryes (though I’d put money on it that they probably will), however this one will likely still be somewhat of a one-of-a-kind in its own right as future potential releases would likely be released at different ages and no doubt at least slightly different flavor profiles.

With that in mind, I can’t really say there is anything about the flavor profile that really or screams unique in any sense. Instead, I have to acknowledge its balance and overall drinkability, combined with the nice intensity brought forward at its proof point of around 120...which seems to be right about where I like Knob Creek products the best.","We first wrote about this limited edition Knob Creek in our New 2018 Whiskeys article, and at the time hypothesized that it might be released at $125+ given Knob Creek’s previous history with both the Knob Creek 2001 series and Knob Creek 25th Anniversary coming in around $130. Maybe because this is a rye, or maybe because Beam is trying to aggressively expand their rye lineup and bring more positive attention to it, the suggested price of $70 is much lower than I would have anticipated.

With rising prices in the bourbon (and rye) market, a lower price sets the stage for a thought provoking discussion. Does it feel like a good value solely because it’s priced less than expected? Or does it feel cheap...like it’s not worthy of a real limited edition price tag...maybe simply because it’s a rye - bourbon’s red-headed stepchild in a sense?

To me $70 still feels like a reasonable price...though that comes with a caveat. Unlike other limited editions that seem to have some value just simply for what they are - their age, their story, their truly limited nature - this one seems to have more value in its flavor profile and drinkability than anything else. It’s not one I feel has any business being collected, or sold for a profit on the secondary market. Instead, it’s just a damn good rye that’s priced at a premium and will probably be reasonably available and hopefully opened and enjoyed by most (assuming the release numbers are similar to some of Knob Creek’s previous limited releases).

On the other hand if you’re expecting it to be twice as good as the standard Knob Creek Rye because it’s twice the price, then you’ll be disappointed. It’s more refined and more robust, but the increase in overall quality is subtle. Part of Knob Creek’s problem is the high quality and value of their standard releases, which makes it hard to swallow paying two to three times more for a limited release that might be only marginally better. But that’s the rub, and thankfully the increase isn’t as much as it probably could have been, or is in many other cases when it comes to limited editions.","Knob Creek Cask Strength Rye is a limited edition rye that tastes good and comes in at a good price, though it lacks other special qualities...as a result, its true value lies in simply opening and enjoying it.","It’s refreshing to drink a whiskey that’s positioned as a limited edition that tastes good but otherwise doesn’t have any inherently special qualities or will break the bank, though everyone’s threshold is different. Kentucky Owl Rye Batch 1 achieved this. Barrell Bourbon batches achieve this as well. I’m talking about whiskeys that are priced at a premium, but also worth more opening and enjoying than they are collecting dust. I can’t say that about some of the more expensive releases hitting the market nowadays, which ultimately aren’t worth their MSRP in my mind. There are a growing number of whiskeys that might be good, just okay or even not so great but in any event don’t warrant their price tag. I can’t help but instinctively do the mental math every time I have a pour of one of them and think of how much it “cost” me in lost potential, or even actual out of pocket cost, instead of thinking about the whiskey itself. I’ve always enjoyed Knob Creek, found their everyday whiskeys to be of pretty good value, and like seeing this lineup expansion. In this case, at only $70 for a one-off batch it’s worth exploring, and you won’t feel guilty about cracking that wax even if it turns out it’s not your jam.

,Knob Creek Quarter Oak Bourbon,Classification: Straight Bourbon,Company: Beam Suntory,Distillery: Jim Beam,Release Date: September 2019,Proof: 100,Age: NAS,"Mashbill: 77% Corn, 13% Rye, 10% Malted Barley",Color: Golden Honey,MSRP: $50 (2019),Official Website,"Knob Creek Quarter Oak is the latest limited release in the Knob Creek line. To create Quarter Oak, Beam Suntory ages their standard Knob Creek for a minimum of four years in a quarter cask (13 gallons versus a standard whiskey barrel’s 53 gallon capacity). Then a small amount of this quarter cask aged Knob Creek is blended with standard Knob Creek bourbon to create the final product. Blend ratios were not released by Beam Suntory. See the company press release for more information.","At the forefront, rich honey and oak mingle together with vanilla, leather, cinnamon, mixed dried fruit, and brown sugar hiding behind. There’s a surprisingly stronger amount of ethanol than expected for a 100 proof bourbon. Despite this, the nose is layered and nuanced bringing forth a really nice balance of sweet and dry flavors. Subtle, yet full of flavor - sans the stronger presence of ethanol which holds back the nose from being really great - it’s a good introduction and foreshadows what’s to come.","While ethanol plays a prominent part in the nose, its impact on the palate is less so, and this whiskey sips as expected for a 100 proof bourbon. It has a lighter mouthfeel and one that allows you to roll it around in your mouth without impedance by the ethanol. Notes of sweet cinnamon syrup, heavy dry aged oak, sugared figs, dried peaches, and vanilla cream are prominent. Much like the nose, the palate is a nice interplay between sweet and dry flavors.","Knob Creek Quarter Oak shines the most in the finish and really distinguishes itself from regular Knob Creek in this portion of the sip. A pleasant warming heat carries through for the entire finish. The flavors are straightforward, mainly showcasing rich oak, leather, a flash of syrup, and a hint of cinnamon spice. The finish ends on a long, dry oak note topped with baked cinnamon bark,and pepper that lasts and lasts. It’s a great way to cap the sip off.","Compared to Knob Creek Small Batch, Knob Creek Quarter Oak delivers a deeper, richer flavor profile thanks to the additional contact that the whiskey had with the quarter casks. The presence of dry oak and leather flavors and sweeter notes, in particular, a consistent cinnamon flavor that is present throughout the entire sip. Since only a small percentage (according to Beam Suntory) of the Knob that was aged in the quarter cask is blended back in with standard Knob Creek, you’re most likely getting a very skewed ratio of standard Knob Creek to Knob Creek Quarter Oak in the mix.

Yet that small ratio has a large impact. One can only imagine what this would taste like if Beam Suntory released Knob Creek Quarter Oak unblended and straight to the bottle. The large amount of craft distilleries that use quarter oak barrels gives us a slight preview, and also understanding why Beam Suntory didn’t go this route. Still it would be interesting to see what a fully aged Knob Creek turns into after being barrel finished in a quarter oak barrel for an additional four yer.","Knob Creek Small Batch is a really great value for what it is at only $35. For $15 more, Knob Creek Quarter Oak delivers a nice variation from the standard small batch that seems to add a nice amount of depth to flavor. It’s not on equal footing with some of the other limited releases that came out in 2019, however, coming in at only $50, most people won’t be bothered by this fact either. For the price though, you’re landing right in the range of a Knob Creek Single Barrel, which delivers a more robust 120 proof pour and is usually a great sip at a fantastic value. All things considered, $50 is a fair price for what Knob Creek Quarter Oak ultimately delivers.",Knob Creek Quarter Oak's additional time in wood elevates Knob Creek Small Batch through a deep rich flavor profile.,"Knob Creek Quarter Oak is a nice addition to the Knob Creek line. It improves on the standard Knob Creek Small Batch, yet doesn’t wow you like some of the Knob Creek Single Barrels can. The overall sip is well balanced and delivers a nice mix of sweet and rich dry flavors, especially between the predominant cinnamon and oak found throughout. The price is fair considering, and its relative availability makes it an easy limited release for many to experience. If you’re a fan of the Jim Beam Small Batch Collection, and Knob Creek in particular, this is a release that you’ll want to track down.

,Larceny Barrel Proof Batch A120,Classification: Straight Bourbon,Company: Heaven Hill,Distillery: Heaven Hill,Release Date: January 2020,Proof: 123.2,Age: NAS (Company states that batches will contain six to eight year old bourbon),"Mashbill: 68% Corn, 20% Wheat, 12% Malted Barley",Color: Deep Amber,MSRP: $50 (2020),Official Website,"In September 2012, Heaven Hill introduced the standard 92 proof Larceny to the market as “heir to the wheated bourbons that make up the historic Old Fitzgerald franchise.” The name “Larceny” and key pictured on the bottle is derived from the story of John Fitzgerald, who was believed to be a Treasury agent who “used his keys to the warehouses to pilfer bourbon from the finest barrels,” which were referred to as “Fitzgerald barrels.""

Similar to the strategy Heaven Hill utilizes with their Elijah Craig Barrel Proof line of multiple releases in a year, Larceny Barrel Proof will be released on an allocated basis three times per year: January, May and September. Each release will have different proofs and consist of bourbon aged six to eight years. The first character in the batch name designates which batch of the year that bottle came from, the numeral that follows represents the month of the release, and the last two digits indicate the corresponding year of the release.","A strong, yet tempered aroma of brown sugar, molasses, Cracker Jack, toasted oak, and walnut. Hints of orange, apple, and tobacco leaf gently mix in providing contrast and complexity. It’s quite enjoyable, but not shockingly unique. Its nose is what you’d expect from a barrel proof Larceny, which is exactly what this it needs to be.","A rush of sweet and bold flavors greets you, as gooey-sweet caramel, rich vanilla, brown sugar, mild cinnamon, and heavy oak provide the backbone of this bourbon. It’s not overly complicated or challenging as it instead presents its flavors in a very drinkable way. Namely, it focuses on sweetness above all else. I also found rolling this bourbon around in my mouth opens up its flavors more and makes its best impression this way.","Some bitterness develops on the finish that’s amplified by its ramp up of heat. Heavy oak, vanilla, and dark chocolate dominate the medium-length finish that does little to enhance the bourbon. While flavorful, it’s a straightforward affair that’s a bit too bold at times and, as a result, forgoes the delightfulness of the palate.","There was an incredibly strong run of barrel proof bourbons in 2019 and Larceny Barrel Proof has the challenge of following them. In previous years when it seemed like every company was releasing their own barrel proof whiskey, few truly stood out. High proof and bold flavors were all accounted for, but few brought something unique to the pour. It isn’t enough to simply offer high proof and bold flavors in a crowded market. You have to offer something beyond that.

When Nick and Jordan visited Heaven Hill in summer of 2019, they tasted Larceny straight from the barrel. To their surprise, the single barrels they tasted were unbalanced and noticeably tannic at barrel proof, though they were drastically better when proofed down. When Heaven Hill announced Larceny Barrel Proof, they made the point that it was going to be released in batches three times a year. Upon tasting Batch A120, it was immediately noticeable to Nick and Jordan that batching had a dramatic impact on the overall taste and quality of the pour. All three of us had an immediate reaction to our pour: wow, this is tasty and sweet.

Not everyone loves sweet bourbon, so for those drinkers, Larceny Barrel Proof probably won’t be for them. For those that do, its sweetness is the lasting impression Larceny Barrel Proof will make on them. There are very few barrel proof bourbons that are as sweet as this, with Maker’s Mark Cask Strength coming to mind as another - a lot of which has to do with it also being a wheated bourbon. The wheat often adds extra amounts sweetness that rye based barrel proof bourbons don’t always feature to the same degree. In a lineup with other barrel proof bourbons, Larceny Barrel Proof won’t have to worry about blending into the pack because of this.","Anyone who’s had the opportunity to taste the standout in the barrel proof wheated bourbon category, William Larue Weller (WLW), knows just how great, in demand, and therefore, expensive WLW can be. Up until now, the main available and affordable high proof wheater has been Maker's Mark Cask Strength (MMCS). Found at a similar price to Larceny Barrel Proof, its main difference is it is often 10 proof points less. MMCS batches can be just as sweet as Larceny Barrel Proof at times, but lack the boldness of Larceny Barrel Proof and the extra oak intensity that comes with it. While still not as bold as WLW, Larceny Barrel Proof finds itself in a comfortable space in between the two current high proof wheaters.

At $50, not only is Larceny Barrel Proof competitively priced to MMCS, but the extra flavor oomph provides an affordable alternative to WLW, despite not reaching the same heights as Buffalo Trace’s wheater. Even comparing it with almost every other major distillery’s barrel proof whiskey coming in over $50, Larceny Barrel Proof is hitting the market at an extremely competitive price point. Its $50 MSRP, lack of many high proof wheated bourbons, and overall quality puts it squarely in the buy category.","Better late than never, Heaven Hill finally releases a barrel proof Larceny with crowd-pleasing sweet flavors and price.","In its first iteration, Larceny Barrel Proof is impressive. Heaven Hill finally gives us what many whiskey drinkers have been asking for: another affordable and (hopefully) readily available barrel proof wheated bourbon on the market. Larceny Barrel Proof leans heavily into the sweeter side of the flavor spectrum and therefore is quite an easy drinker. This first batch isn’t without its faults though. It lacks complexity, and its finish still sports more bitterness than I care for. Yet it’s still a tasty bourbon that gets better the more you drink it. Unfortunately it isn’t the WLW replacement many hoped it would be, but many may find it as a bolder alternative to MMCS. The brand still has room to improve, but there isl a lot to love about the inaugural batch of Larceny Barrel Proof.

,"Little Book ""The Easy""",Classification:  Blended Straight Whiskey,Company: Beam Suntory,Distillery: Jim Beam,Released: October 2017,Proof: 128.2,Age: NAS,"Mashbill: Undisclosed (proprietary blend of 4 straight whiskeys - 4 year old bourbon, 13 year old corn whiskey, approximately 6 year old 100% malt whiskey, and approximately 6 year old high rye whiskey)",Color:  Copper,MSRP: $80 (2017),Official Website,"According to the company press release, Little Book is “the first and highly anticipated product release from Freddie Noe, eighth generation Beam family member and son of current Beam master distiller, Fred Noe. The debut of Little Book marks an exciting step forward for the next generation of Beam family whiskey makers. Named after the childhood nickname given to Freddie by his grandfather, legendary master distiller, Booker Noe, Little Book is an annual, limited release series that will feature a new and unique blend each year, presented uncut and unfiltered. Guiding each year’s release will be Freddie’s passion for crafting high-quality, interesting blends different from anything else on the market.”

This first edition of Little Book is referred to as “The Easy,” which is said to “draw inspiration from what the Beam family is known for - great bourbon whiskey.” Accordingly, Freddie “worked on the final recipe for over a year and tried more than 25 different blends of liquid before he decided that it was just right and worthy of his debut release.”","Sweet and youthful on the nose. Raw grain, cornbread, and a hint of ginger are robust in their delivery. There’s a touch of ethanol as well, but less than expected for the proof. The aroma is more interesting than it is inviting, though it’s certainly not a deterrent.","Sweet corn and warm buttered cornbread are rounded out by rye spice and the tiniest trace of anise. It’s lively and youthful, but doesn’t taste underaged. It’s definitely grain forward, and despite having bourbon in the blend seems to lack the traditional bourbon flavors of aged oak, caramel, and vanilla. It’s quite intriguing, and for me enjoyable.","Medium in length and surprisingly smooth. A light pop of rye spice comes first, but quickly tapers against sweet corn and a bit of seasoned oak. This being oak’s first appearance in the flavor profile, it serves to add a layer of dimension and solidifies the presence of higher aged whiskey within the blend, though it’s still quite subtle.","Few would argue that Little Book isn’t unique. In fact, that’s probably the single thing everyone will agree on. With that being said, blends are increasingly common, and blending to a greater extent is even standard practice in some cases. In Canada, for example, they ferment, distill, age, and then blend each grain separately to arrive at the final product. As for recent releases a close comparison is Diageo’s Gifted Horse - a blend 4 year old bourbon and corn whiskey along with a 17 year old bourbon. It was met with mixed reception, but most agreed it was unusual. In his review of Gifted Horse, Eric described the different components as bringing out the worst in one another, an observation I agreed with.

With Little Book, it’s interesting because the bottle isn’t from a craft whiskey distillery experimenting with something new. It comes from one of Kentucky’s major distilleries and serves to introduce the world to the company’s next generation master distiller. It challenges the drinker, presenting a flavor profile that pushes the envelope of a traditional flavor profile. But not so far that it breaks any established barriers. While some will go so far as to find the flavor profile a bit odd, I do think there will be some who downright dislike it. With multi-whiskey-type blends, the various whiskeys can sometimes come together in a much more subdued nature than might be expected, each kind of mellowing the unique characteristics of the others. Alternatively, they can bring out the worst in one another. Fortunately, in this case the end result doesn’t taste like a Frankenstein whiskey, or one that has been overly subdued. The whiskeys marry together nicely but don’t overpower one another, delivering an end result that’s uniquely different in an elegant and well-balanced way.","Little Book is a barrel proof limited edition from a major Kentucky distillery. It’s the first edition in what is going to be an ongoing limited edition series, which means it could become a collector’s item at some point. It presents a unique blend and unique resulting flavor profile. Even the company’s own regularly available barrel proof product, Booker’s Bourbon, is already pushing that price point and will be eventually eclipsing it. Take all that into account and $80 for the first ever limited release in a new series and from a major Kentucky distillery certainly seems like a bargain.

But for the whiskey in the bottle the pricing might present a different story, for some at least. While I enjoy it, I think it’s going to be more polarizing than usual and many won’t be nearly as impressed with it as I am. So it’s an $80 risk, and one consumers will just need to figure out for themselves. In any event, it’s likely we’ll see the price of future Little Book editions rise, and at some point many of us will look back and wish we had bought more bottles of this first edition at its MSRP, if for no other reason other than it being the first in its series.","While not everyone will enjoy it, the first limited edition Little Book is a unique blend of whiskeys with an interesting flavor profile offered at a reasonable price."," If you were in Freddie Noe’s shoes, what whiskey would you curate as your first ever offering, a limited edition no less? I’m sure that’s a question Freddie pondered over this past year, and I doubt many would have guessed it would be this. But that’s what makes this whiskey interesting. Experimentation certainly isn’t rare with respect to whiskey. But experimentation along with successful execution can be. When it comes to limited releases, Heaven Hill does it with the Parker’s Heritage Collection, Woodford with their Master’s Collection, and of course Buffalo Trace with the E.H Taylor line and then some. With Little Book, it’s a different take on American Whiskey and I think the result is polarizing, but it’s also well executed if you appreciate a more unique and grain forward flavor profile. I recommend trying Little Book without hesitation, but buy cautiously as it just might not be for everyone.",Nick,3,3.5,3,4,3,3.5,https://www.breakingbourbon.com/review/little-book-the-easy

This year’s edition, Chapter 02, has been titled “Noe Simple Task.” Chapter 02 is a unique blend of whiskeys - an 8 year Kentucky straight rye, 13 year Canadian rye, and 40 year Canadian 100% corn whisky. The blend is bottled uncut at 118.8 proof, and is available nationwide.","A delicate bouquet of apples, summer fruits, and herbal aromas greets the senses. It has a light but sweet presence, with an underlying base of ethanol that cannot be ignored. While the ethanol doesn’t completely detract from the experience, it prevents the whiskey’s nose from realizing its full potential.","Ultra sweet, the sip leads with raisins and summer fruits. Butterscotch and honey further give way to a spicy rye note. Floral undertones run throughout. The palate is as playful as it is unexpected and full of flavor. Rolling around in the mouth brings forth a bit more spice, but it remains very sweet overall. It’s incredibly light and approachable given the proof, bringing an unexpected arrangement of flavors into the picture in an enjoyable way.","A crack of spice at first, it quickly diminishes, focusing again on the sweeter flavors. Honey and butterscotch burst back into the forefront, but they trail off, transitioning from sweet to dry. The blast of more robust flavors is quick, but their presence manages to linger leaving a pleasant aftertaste.","“I created Little Book as an honor to my granddaddy, Booker and our shared love for creating unique blends to share with the world.” This phrase is written prominently on the Little Book label, signed by Freddie Noe. In the bottle this year is a blend of 8 year old Kentucky straight rye along with two Canadian whiskeys - a 13 year rye and 40 year 100% corn based whiskey.

The blend percentages aren’t disclosed, but coming in at 118.8 proof relative to the proofs of the three whiskeys in the blend suggests the 8 year Kentucky straight rye is potentially a high portion. It is, however, possible that it’s not. The flavor profile alludes to the possibility that Little Book Chapter 02 is an entirely different animal from a typical Kentucky straight rye, potentially a high percentage of Canadian whiskey - maybe there’s more 40 year old 100% corn whiskey than would be assumed.","No different than Chapter 01, Little Book Chapter 02 is priced relatively low when compared to other limited releases from major Kentucky distilleries. While it is a $20 price increase over last year’s $80 price tag, it’s still a low price for a limited release relatively speaking. Considering the polarizing flavor profile, this might still be too much for some. But considering each year’s release will be unique, with Chapter 02 being no exception to that, it’s a reasonable price in today’s frenzied marketplace. If I could go back, I would buy a few more Chapter 01 bottles which were readily available for a time at MSRP. Considering how unique tasting Chapter 02 is, I suspect this year will be the same as Chapter 01 when it comes to availability.",An unexpected flavor profile and reasonable price tag for a limited release makes Little Book Chapter 02 a gamble that will pay off for those who end up liking it.,"In a sea of neverending bourbon and whiskey releases, it’s refreshing to see something different. A lighter flavor profile highlighted by sweet notes of fruit, butterscotch, and honey with floral undertones, Little Book Chapter 02 is an approachable whiskey that pushes beyond the boundaries of the expected for a whiskey marketed towards bourbon fans. It accomplishes exactly what the label suggests, and for that reason I applaud Beam and Freddie Noe for living up to their promise. While I do think a lot of bourbon enthusiasts won’t appreciate its not-so-typical flavor profile, for those that do, the good news is it should be reasonably available at MSRP.

,Maker's Mark 46 Cask Strength Bourbon,Classification: Bourbon,Company: Beam Suntory,Distillery: Maker's Mark,Released: September 2015 (Ongoing at gift shop),Proof: 109.6,Age: NAS (Around 6 years),"Mashbill: 70% Corn, 16% Wheat, 14% Malted Barley",Color:  Amber,MSRP: $38 (375 ml) (2016),Official Website,"Maker’s 46 Cask Strength is the barrel proof version of the standard Maker’s 46. Maker’s 46 starts off as standard Maker’s Mark, which is a wheated bourbon made in batches of less than 1,000 gallons. Then heavily seared French oak staves are placed in just-emptied standard Maker's Mark barrels, which are then refilled and returned to the warehouses to finish aging for an undisclosed amount of time (estimated to be 2-3 additional months).

The Maker’s 46 Cask Strength version comes in between 108-114 proof. The bottle being reviewed is proofed at 109.6. Currently, this is only sold in the Maker’s Mark distillery gift shop in 375 ml bottles.","I expected a richer and deeper experience than the standard Maker’s 46, instead I’m greeted with something else. I assumed that the cask strength version would enhance all the scents, instead it seems to mute some, while pulling out others. The nose is comprised of rich oak, syrupy vanilla, raisins, banana bread, and an underlying scent of ethanol. A really nice combination that’s still very enjoyable.","The palate presents a nice balance of flavors for its proof. Lots of butter, toffee, toasted sugar, and baked raisins in syrup are all noticeable, and are layered on top of an ever present base of oak. This palate is to standard Maker’s 46 as what standard Maker’s 46 is to standard Maker’s Mark; it’s sweet but not too sweet, and extremely rich and deep in flavor. It drinks more like a sub-100 proof bourbon than one that’s almost 110 proof. It has an extremely great mouthfeel to it and is my favorite Maker’s palate to date.","Rich wood, leather, tobacco, pecans, and vanilla all lead the way of this drier finish. It offers a more sophisticated finish than I experienced with the standard version of Maker’s 46. While it is slightly hotter, it’s only a moderate increase in heat compared with the standard version of Maker’s 46. This is kind of unexpected, as this comes in at almost 20 proof points higher. After an initial blast of flavors, it finishes long with dry and woody notes.","Wheated bourbon lovers everywhere should tip their hats to the fact that Maker’s has now introduced two wheated barrel proof products to the market within the last two years. This is one category that is severely underpopulated, with William Larue Weller being the most well-known barrel proof wheated bourbon available to consumers prior to Maker’s Mark Cask Strength and Maker’s 46 Cask Strength. I wish more distilleries would follow suit, since this is one area that that is presently lacking in the bourbon marketplace.

Maker’s 46 Cask Strength does a nice job of greatly enhancing the flavors that are present in the standard version of Maker’s 46. That being said, it may not be for everyone. If you’re adverse to a woodier tasting bourbon you may want to shy away as the extra exposure to wood staves is really amplified in the cask strength version. This results in a much richer, deeper drinking experience, and a flavor profile that is really quite unique.","A recent trend a lot of distilleries are embracing, is releasing special gift shop only bottlings as 375 ml products. While this might seem like a good way to allow more individuals access to limited edition products, distilleries are also using it as an excuse to upcharge customers. At $38 for a 375 ml bottle, you’re paying about the same price as a standard bottle of Maker’s 46 for half the amount of bourbon. While the flavor profile is definitely different than standard Maker’s 46, I wouldn’t necessarily say it’s worth the 100% upcharge for the price of admission.",A richly enhanced version of the standard Maker’s 46 that drinks lower than its actual proof.,"With the exception of the nose, compared to the standard Maker’s 46, Maker’s 46 Cask Strength offers a fuller, richer drinking experience. After trying Maker’s 46 Cask Strength, I’m left to wonder why they didn’t come out with this version in the first place. The flavors are richer and deeper in nature, and you’re getting to try Maker’s 46 at its fullest potential. The proof is high enough to allow the flavors to pop without being so overpowering to those who may not love high proof bourbons.

A side note about adding water. After adding a few drops, the end result wasn’t spectacular. A lot of the flavors that make this bourbon so unique were muted and I wasn’t very impressed. If you prefer your bourbon lower proof, stick to the standard Maker’s 46, as Maker’s 46 Cask Strength tastes best left un-muddled from water.",Jordan,3,4,3.5,3.5,2,3.5,https://www.breakingbourbon.com/review/makers-mark-46-cask-strength-bourbon
,Maker’s Mark RC6,Classification: Straight Bourbon,Company: Beam Suntory,Distillery: Maker’s Mark,Release Date: September 2019,Proof: 108.2,Age: NAS (Around 6 years),"Mashbill: 70% Corn, 16% Wheat, 14% Malted Barley",Color: Bronze,MSRP: $60,Official Website,"Maker’s Mark Wood Finishing Series 2019 Limited Release: Stave Profile RC6 is Maker’s Mark first ever nationally available limited release. Maker’s RC6 is the first in a collection of Maker’s Mark expressions that will use an innovative wood stave-finishing technique to enhance distinctive characteristics already present in Maker’s Mark Bourbon.

Maker’s RC6 starts off as standard Maker’s Mark, which is a wheated bourbon made in batches of less than 1,000 gallons. Then ten oak staves are placed in just-emptied standard Maker's Mark barrels, which are then refilled and returned to the warehouses to finish aging for an undisclosed amount of time. The staves used in Maker’s RC6 were developed over the course of two years in partnership with barrel producer Independent Stave Company. Stave Profile RC6 is made from American Oak that has first been exposed to the outdoors, or “seasoned,” for an extended 18 months before being toasted in a convection oven.

Maker’s RC6 will be comprised of only 255 barrels in total. More information can be found in the press release.  ","There’s no denying that this shares traits with Maker’s Mark 46 Cask Strength. Rich oak, syrup soaked raisins, and a big dose of ethanol are all present. However, Maker’s RC6 differs in the fact that on top of those scents, there’s also heavy doses of brown sugar and dried fruits, along with a slight dash of dark chocolate. These scents all pair perfectly together resulting in a big rich aroma that draws you back for more.","The palate is sweet and yet, also dry, which is a combination that works here. A dry oak and toasted brown sugar is dominant and mixes with black pepper, cinnamon bark, canned fruits, and raisins. The higher proof works well in pulling out these flavors yet also allows them to remain well balanced.","A blast of heat starts the finish followed by tannic oak, leather, tobacco, and a hint of pepper. As the finish progresses, a peppery heat and dry oak remain, as the other flavors fade away. The finish’s flavors are long and lingering, and are a nice way to end the sip.","Maker’s Mark RC6 is similar in nature to Maker’s Mark 46 Cask Strength and the company’s Maker’s Mark Private Select line. All of the offerings contain 10 seared oak staves in their finishing process. However, where Maker’s RC6 differentiates, is by the fact that it uses 10 virgin toasted American oak staves that haven’t been utilized in past releases.

Maker’s RC6 isn’t the first Maker’s Mark product to utilize a special set of 10 seared oak staves, as Maker’s Seared Bu 1-3 was a limited release that utilized 10 virgin seared & Sous-Vide French oak staves. This 1,400 bottle release came in 375ml bottles and was only available at the distillery in 2018. This was clearly a prelude for the company’s new limited release series that played off of the wood staves as a finishing agent.

Tastewise, Maker’s RC6 is almost on par with the original release of Maker’s 46 Cask Strength. I was pleased to see this, as I feel that the original release of Maker’s 46 Cask Strength is still the best tasting version of a staved finished Maker’s product that the company has released. It nicely highlights the oak influence while pulling forward a sweeter flavor profile.","Maker’s chose an interesting pricing strategy for their first ever national limited release. While other distilleries are slowly raising their limited release pricing, Maker’s Mark introduced this release at only $60. This is around $10-$20 below what you’ll see most Maker’s Mark Private Selects go for. It’s refreshing to see and hopefully a trend that other distilleries will start to follow. Considering the quality of the sip, Maker’s RC6 delivers a fantastic value to the consumer.",Maker’s Mark's first national limited edition is a perfect example of how a subtle change and a reasonable price tag go a long way in helping you stand out above the crowd.,"Maker’s Mark RC6 is really good. It won’t reign supreme over some of the other limited releases that came out in 2019, yet it can certainly hold its own. The interplay between the oak and sweeter flavors results in a well-balanced sip that is both rich and bold. In addition, the very reasonable price tag is a nice change of pace from the ongoing inflated prices the market seems willing to bear these last few years. If you’re a fan of Maker’s Mark, wheated bourbons, or just want to say you were able to try a limited release this year without breaking the bank, Maker’s Mark RC6 is a bottle that you’ll want to seek out.",Jordan,4,3.5,3.5,4,4,3.5,https://www.breakingbourbon.com/review/makers-mark-rc6
,Maker’s Mark SE4 x PR5,Classification: Straight Bourbon,Company: Beam Suntory,Distillery: Maker’s Mark,Release Date: Fall 2020,Proof: 110.8,Age: NAS,"Mashbill: 70% Corn, 16% Wheat, 14% Malted Barley",Color: Bronze,MSRP: $60 (2020),Official Website,"Maker’s Mark Wood Finishing Series 2020 Limited Release: Stave Profile SE4 x PR5 is Maker’s Mark second ever nationally available limited release following 2019’s RC6. The staves for this year’s release were specially chosen to heighten Maker’s Mark’s vanilla (PR5) and caramel (SE4) notes.

Maker’s SE4 x PR5 starts off as standard Maker’s Mark, which is a wheated bourbon made in batches of less than 1,000 gallons. Then ten oak staves are placed in just-emptied standard Maker's Mark barrels, which are then refilled and returned to the warehouses to finish aging. The company used two unique stave profiles (SE4xPR5) – developed in partnership with Independent Stave Company for this year’s release. These staves are a marriage of virgin toasted American oak (PR5) and virgin French oak (SE4) staves which were aged outside for a full year. In the end the company used a blend of these stave finishes. The final bourbon blend is approximately 13% of the SE4 stave aged for six weeks, 32% of the SE4 stave aged for five weeks, and 55% of the PR5 stave aged for four weeks.

More information can be found in the press release.","An oaky undertone weaves together with dried vanilla bean, syrup, baking spices and a hint of cinnamon apple. These scents are supported by a pleasant layer of caramel which acts as a good base. While the proof isn’t shy about making itself known, it adds just the right amount of ethanol to let you know that this is a barrel proof bourbon. Overall, the aromas are nicely packaged and deliver a great start to the sip.","Large doses of spiced vanilla and baking spices are topped with a touch of burnt caramel. A thread of syrup weaves itself through, adding a touch of sweetness. SE4 x PR5 delivers a spicier palate than you would expect for a wheated bourbon, and in the end the flavors work well together to form a delicious fusion.","Sweet notes of caramel and vanilla hit for just a second before being almost bulldozed by aged oak and leather. While a thread of vanilla tries to hang on, it just can’t keep up with the aged oak and leather. These two flavors can often come across as dry, however here they manage to toe the line just enough to keep them enjoyable. This combo flavor lingers and sticks stays with you for minutes afterwards.","Maker’s Mark’s limited edition Wood Finishing Series is similar in nature to Maker’s Mark 46 Cask Strength and the company’s Private Select line. All of the offerings utilize 10 seared oak staves in their finishing process. However, where Maker’s SE4 x PR5 differs is that it uses a blend of bourbons rested with different proprietary staves and varying finishing times.

By its very nature, Maker’s Mark 46 is quite a labor intensive bourbon. Not only do you need to dump the barrels and rebarrel them, you also need to add in the 10 wooden staves. SE4 x PR5 takes that one additional step by using two different distinct stave profiles and adding in a blend percentage of varying times on top of that. Usually for a limited release, it’s around a special age, proof, or a special selection of barrels. It’s less often you find such a labor intensive process taken in any release, limited or otherwise.

While labor may make it unique, a bourbon’s uniqueness is mainly judged on its flavor rather than how it is produced. SE4 x PR5 offers a similar but slightly different experience to RC6. Whereas RC6 delivered more of a sweet-and-dry flavor profile, SE4 x PR5 relies heavily on a spiced flavor profile combined with a balanced dose of sweet. It doesn’t best RC6, instead it offers a complimentary flavor profile that is sure to please any who may have found last year’s to not be spicy enough. It’s a worthy successor to RC6 and to the overall heritage of the Maker’s 46 production process.","Last year’s RC6 was a breath of fresh air when it came to limited releases. Not only was it priced at a reasonable $60, it was noticeably cheaper than other limited releases in 2019. It’s again refreshing to see that Maker’s Mark decided to buck the trend of ever-increasing prices on limited edition bourbons and instead stick to that same $60 price tag. Seeing as SE4 x PR5 provides a great well-rounded sip, it seems like one of the best deals out there compared to all of the other limited editions released this year.","With an easy-to-swallow price and an easier-to-swallow sip, Maker’s Mark Wood Finishing Series is quickly becoming a highlight of the fall bourbon limited release season.","SE4 x PR5 had lofty expectations to meet after last year's success of RC6. I was curious to see what this year's Wood Finishing Series would look like. The resulting bourbon is one that will please Maker’s Mark 46 and wheated bourbon fans alike. SE4 x PR5 shows the impact that various staves can have on a flavor profile, and is a worthy successor to last year's release of RC6. The sip is a complex mix of spices and sweetness that mingle well together and deliver an overall drinking experience that is hard to fault for the price.",Jordan,3.5,4,3.5,4,4,3.5,https://www.breakingbourbon.com/review/makers-mark-se4-x-pr5
,Old Fitzgerald Bottled-in-Bond 13 Year Spring 2019 Release,Classification: Straight Bourbon,Company: Heaven Hill,Distillery: Heaven Hill,Release Date: May 2019,Proof: 100,Age: 13 Years,"Mashbill: 75% Corn, 20% Wheat, 5% Malted Barley",Color: Dark Bronze,MSRP: $130 (2019),Official Website,"Produced in September 2005 and bottled in February 2019, this is the 3rd of 10 in Heaven Hill’s Old Fitzgerald Bottled-in-Bond series. These is a bi-annual release with the first arriving in the spring of 2018. Each season in the series denoted by different color labels, with the spring releases sporting a green colored label. Additionally, each bottle comes with a faux tax strip that discloses when the bourbon was produced and bottled.

To be labelled Bottled-in-Bond, the whiskey must be the product of one distillation season and one distiller at a single distillery, aged in a federally bonded warehouse under U.S. government supervision for at least four years, and it must be bottled at exactly 100 proof. Additionally, the Bottled-in-Bond label must clearly identify the distillery where it was distilled and where it was bottled, if different.","The nose opens with a warm mix of scents. Baked sweet bread, allspice, cinnamon bark, light custard, and a touch of seasoned oak come together in a harmonious way. It’s an enticing way to start and really invites you to explore the sip more.","A touch of heat and nice amount of sweetness form the base of this bourbon. Summer fruits, yellow cake, vanilla, and honey mingle with a base layer of light spice. The flavors come across as more impactful and the bourbon drinks a little hotter than you would expect from a 100 proof bourbon. The end result is a very satisfying sip that’s hard to dislike.","The extra time this bourbon spent in the barrel shows in the finish. Oak, white pepper, and sweet summer fruits are quite noticeable up front. These transition to vanilla, a lingering heat, and eventually just oak. Medium in length, while the finish is still good, comparatively it’s the weakest part of the overall sip.","As I mentioned in my Old Fitzgerald Bottled-in-Bond 9 Year Fall 2018 review, Bottled-in-Bond bourbons, while not a dime a dozen, are quite plentiful nowadays. From an age perspective, the spring 2019 release isn’t the oldest to date either. That honor goes to the 14 year distillery only release that came out in the fall of 2018.

From a flavor perspective however, the spring 2019 release is a really great wheated bourbon. While it doesn’t quite match the level that the fall 2018 release delivered, it comes very close. For the most part its flavors are well balanced and defined, and its sip stands out from the other Bottled-in-Bond bourbons on the market.","The nice aspect about this Old Fitzgerald series, is that Heaven Hill seems to be pricing by the year in $10 increments. While that isn’t the norm with most limited release bottles, it seems to work well here. In this case, $130 for a 13 year Bottled-in-Bond seems like a fair value, especially one with such an impressive flavor profile. Sure you could say that about Weller 12 Year, but even if you were able to find a bottle at MSRP, Weller 12 Year comes in at 10 proof points lower and doesn’t carry the Bottled-in-Bond designation either. Add in the fact that 13 year old wheated bourbons aren’t at all common and its throwback decanter style bottle is a great talking piece, and you get a great overall value.",Heaven Hill’s Old Fitzgerald Bottled-in-Bond series is a good reminder that you don’t always need to be barrel proof to deliver a flavorful and impressive sip.,"Once again Heaven Hill proves why they’re currently the king at producing Bottled-in-Bond bourbons. Old Fitzgerald Bottled-in-Bond 13 Year Spring 2019 release is a worthy successor to the fantastic fall 2018 release. Unfortunately, it’s not quite as refined, thanks to its overly oaky finish. At the same time it is still an elegant sip overall, and delivers a ton of flavor in its nose and palate.

I envision the majority of those who get their hands on this bottle will really enjoy it. And make no mistake, if you do find yourself in possession of this release, make sure you do yourself a favor and crack the bottle open. As great as the bourbon looks in its throwback decanter, it will taste even better in your glass.",Jordan,4,4,3,3.5,3.5,3.5,https://www.breakingbourbon.com/review/old-fitzgerald-bottled-in-bond-13-year-spring-2019-release
,Old Forester 1897 Bottled in Bond Bourbon,Classification: Straight Bourbon,Company: Brown-Forman,Distillery: Brown-Forman Shively Distillery,Released: September 2015,Proof: 100,Age: NAS,"Mashbill: 72% Corn, 18% Rye, 10% Malted Barley",Color:  Medium-dark Amber,MSRP: $50 (2015),Official Website,"Old Forester 1897 Bottled In Bond is the second expression in the Old Forester Whiskey Row Series. According to the neck tag on the bottle, “This small batch craft expression will be presented in a lightly filtered old style, reminiscent of a 19th century bourbon, rich and bold in barrel character.” The “1897” in the name pays homage to the year the Bottled-in-Bond Act was passed, while the bourbon itself pays tribute to the historical Bottled-in-Bond bourbon Old Forester actually produced at the time of the Act. Brown-Forman intends for this to be a permanent brand.",A bright and lively blast of fruit with complementing floral and oak elements. The light sting from the alcohol is warming with a slight burn. Really nice and inviting overall.,"A great mix of sweet and spicy. Dark fruit is most prominent, with hints of caramel, vanilla, and just the right amount of oak rounding it out. The sweetness here is balanced by a nearly perfect spice note. It coats the mouth nicely making for a great mouthfeel. Overall well-rounded and quite balanced.","Long, sweet, and almost perfectly balanced. The flavors in the palate linger for minutes after the sip with a tapering sweetness and light spiciness leaving a great aftertaste. One of the better finishes I’ve experienced in a while.","The Bottled-in-Bond designation doesn’t seem to have the significance today that it once did. The historical references make it pretty clear the Act was necessary to help consumers avoid adulterated whiskey, which could have conceivably had just about anything added to it for flavoring or coloring purposes. Today, I associate Bottled-in-Bond with low cost, surprisingly good whiskeys such as Old Grand Dad Bourbon and Rittenhouse Rye - of which are probably overlooked too often in favor of more popular labels and better bottle designs. The exception to this is E.H. Taylor, which is marketed as a premium line of Bottled-in-Bond whiskeys with additional distinguishing characteristics - small batch, single barrel, barrel proof, rye, etc. I’d argue those additional characteristics seem to take the spotlight, often making us forget that the Taylor line is, in fact, Bottled-in-Bond. The point is, the concept of introducing a premium Bottled-in-Bond whiskey is not new, but it’s also not popular and not well associated with premium brands. Brown-Forman appears to be employing a marketing strategy here, playing into both the year of the Act with its name as well as tribute to their own historical Bottled-in-Bond offering when the act was passed. I’m cool with that. Where whiskey marketing with historical reference is often a reach at best, this actually has some real meaning and a seal of quality to go with it.

As for taste, the most prominent characteristic for me is the fruit-forward character which is somewhat similar to Old Forester’s first Whiskey Row release, 1870 Original Batch. The 1897 Bottled In Bond certainly provides deeper flavor intensity due to the higher proof and richer mouthfeel, and although not exactly the same, the underlying characteristics are similar. Regardless, none of this makes for a knock-your-socks-off unique flavor profile, but it does offer enough to set the taste slightly apart from anything else I can think of.","This is priced at a premium, but today’s marketplace commands it. It’s one thing to suddenly raise the price of something already on the shelf, say Elijah Craig 12 year from $25 to $50 (prediction: this will happen, just not suddenly). However, when introducing a new premium offering it’s not unexpected to see it priced that way right out of the gate. With that in mind, this pricing is also in the area of some excellent options - Four Roses Single Barrel 100 Proof ($35-$45), Four Roses Private Selections Barrel Proof ($55-$65), Knob Creek Single Barrel($40-$45), Blanton’s Single Barrel ($50-$60), and Russell’s Reserve Single Barrel ($50-$55), to name a few. I haven’t spent enough time with this bourbon to really let it sink in as I have with the others listed, but based on my experience so far the quality is there to merit the price point. I think this will sell well and I could see some enthusiasts finding the flavor profile ideal to include as one of their daily sippers.","A great nose, full and fruit-forward flavor profile, and an outstanding finish make this premium Bottled-in-Bond bourbon worthy of its tribute to the Bottled-in-Bond Act of 1897.","As the second release in Brown-Forman’s Whiskey Row series, it’s great to see quality again as we experienced with the first Whiskey Row release, 1870 Original Batch. The pricing also falls right in place with the first release for what we’re getting and the flavor profile shares enough similarity to relate the two, yet differs enough to justify this as a stand-alone bottling. For those who found 1870 Original Batch a little light but generally enjoyed it, the additional 10 proof points, fullness of flavor, and similar underlying dark fruit characteristics with this one are exactly what the doctor ordered. The flavor is quite enjoyable, and I can’t help but think a barrel proof version of this would be outstanding. Based on the flavor profiles of these first two releases in the Whiskey Row series, I’m somewhat expecting their fourth release, “1923” to be essentially that - it will be a 125 proof version of their original recipe. Until then, I will be thoroughly enjoying this 1897 Bottled In Bond edition.

,Old Forester 1910 Old Fine Whisky,Classification: Straight Bourbon,Company: Brown-Forman,Distillery: Brown-Forman Shively Distillery,Released: October 2018,Proof: 93,Age: NAS,"Mashbill: 72% Corn, 18% Rye, 10% Malted Barley",Color:  Dark Bronze,MSRP: $55 (2018),Official Website,"Old Forester 1910 is the fourth and final expression in the Whiskey Row series. First launched in 2014, the series consists of Old Forester 1870 Original Batch, Old Forester 1897 Bottled in Bond, and Old Forester 1920 Prohibition Style.

According to Brown-Forman “1910 Old Fine Whisky represents a specific point in Old Forester’s nearly 150-year-old history. In October 1910, a fire caused the bottling line to be shut down for an indefinite period of time. Complicating matters, there was a vat of mature whisky waiting to be bottled. Otherwise facing ruin, this whisky was instead stored in new, charred oak containers to rest until the line could be repaired.” This double barreling was the first such documented of its kind and led to it gaining the name Old Fine Whisky.

In order to produce 1910, standard Old Forester has undergone a second barreling in a lightly toasted, heavily charred barrel. “Mature Old Forester enters a second barrel at 100 proof, just as it did in 1910,” said Old Forester Master Taster Jackie Zykan. “The second barrel is charred nearly to the point of incineration.”","Oaky and lightly sweet. Rich caramel leads the way with an undertone of vanilla, fresh baked cake, frosting, and a dab of sweet pecans. A light layer of rich oak rounds it out. It’s subtle yet easy to appreciate and foreshadows the rest of the sip. I found the nose continued to become more and more enjoyable as I let the pour sit in the glass. This is one bourbon that you’ll want to take your time with when drinking.","Old Forester 1910 delivers a nice, thick and chewy mouthfeel. The sugars from the char are really evident. The palate is sickly sweet with a heavy layer of burnt caramel and vanilla. Hidden deep beneath are dark berries along with toasted marshmallows. All of these flavors rest upon a layer of oak. It’s amazing how viscous the mouthfeel is. It’s not incredibly deep in terms of flavor range, however it’s extremely enjoyable.","While oak played a role in the nose and palate, oak is front and center in the finish. A dominating flavor of charred oak leads the charge and is intermingled with a light dose of caramel and vanilla. These sweeter flavors fade and are replaced with dry leather and light cigar box. These flavors linger for an unusually long time. It’s a satisfying finish and one that makes you realize how well this bourbon might pair with a cigar.","The Whiskey Row series has been a great experiment in showing just how different Old Forester can taste when varying the proof and aging conditions. Old Forester 1910 is no exception to this, and delivers another unique tasting experience that’s completely different from the rest of the series. The first question most will ask themselves, is how does this hold up to the fantastic Old Forester 1920? I have to admit, that this question lingered in my mind as I started this review until I realized that this isn’t the comparison that Old Forester 1910 deserves.

Unlike in 1910 when Old Forester first pioneered the concept of double barreling bourbon, this technique is now more widely used today. In fact, Brown-Forman embraced this same technique when they launched Woodford Reserve Double Oaked. When comparing the two, it’s interesting to see just how much more of an impact the double barreling had on Old Forester 1910 versus Woodford Double Oaked. I find Double Oaked to be a very enjoyable product, but Old Forester 1910 seems to deliver an enhanced sip in most areas. The charred barrel impact is very evident in both the sweetness delivered in the palate and the consistent oak flavoring throughout the sip. Surprisingly, the oak isn’t overdone, which results in a rich overall sip and lingering oaky finish.","This is the second highest priced bottle in the Whiskey Row series. However don’t let that fool you. This entire series is separated by only $15 from the cheapest to the most expensive. Kudos should be given to Brown-Forman for making the entire series affordable for most.

In comparison to the aforementioned Woodford Double Oaked, the $10 price premium feels justified for the elevated product you’re getting. Anything above MSRP would be pricing this too high, but at this price, you’re able to still enjoy a rich, albeit oaky, bourbon for under $60. While it’s tempting to pay $5 more for Old Forester 1920, you’d also be buying a totally different tasting product and missing out on the experience Old Forester 1910 delivers in its own right.",The last expression in the Whiskey Row series delivers a uniquely satisfying experience that stands out among both its siblings and other double barreled expressions at large.,"For some, this release may find the extreme char may be too much. Oak is predominant throughout the entire sip and lingers for a long time once the sip ends. However I find this to be Old Forester 1910’s main selling point. The oak influence comes off as refined and sweet and doesn’t come across as dry until the very end. It’s a nice deviation from other double barreled products on the market and one that finds a nice place in the Whiskey Row series lineup.

OId Forester 1910 had high expectations to live up to. It was saved as the last expression in the Whiskey Row series and it came after the highly adored Old Forester 1920. Despite not quite living up to the same bang for your buck that Old Forester 1920 delivers, it does succeed in delivering a unique sip that’s very enjoyable in its own right.

To honor him, Brown-Forman released an Old Forester Birthday Bourbon. This bourbon is a special annual release that started in September 2002 and varies year to year based on age, warehouse location, number of barrels used, and so on. The bourbon comes in a special old fashioned glass bottle and is an anticipated release every year in the bourbon community. The 2013 bottling of Old Forester Birthday Bourbon marks the 12th year that Brown-Forman has offered this bourbon. This is also the first year that specific information about the release was removed from the label.","Cinnamon, chocolate, vanilla, and caramel with a slight metallic tinge. A little alcohol pulls through as well resulting in some warming tingling of the nostrils.","The flavors are led by heat up front, more than would be expected for the proof and as compared to preceding releases. A wide range of complex flavors are hiding behind the heat but it takes a little concentration to sort through them. Barrel char, dark chocolate, rye spice, cinnamon stick, cigar box, caramel, and vanilla follow the heat. Burnt brown sugar and citrus round things out. All of this is capped with some more heat as you swallow, so if you drink it too fast you might just miss the complexity of flavors with this one finding heat at the front and backend of the sip. Bold and complex overall.","The heat lingers for a few seconds then immediately tapers off. Hints of the flavors on the palate linger, with barrel char and burnt brown sugar being the most prominent for me. Medium to long lasting.","This edition is the most bold and complex of the limited release Birthday Bourbons I’ve sampled. This also happened to be the first year Brown-Forman stopped giving detail on the bottle, so we may naturally assume it shares a similar mash bill with previous releases. However, the flavor profile is so different this may not be the case, leaving us something to ponder. In fact, I related the flavor profile more closely to Elijah Craig 12 Year and Elijah Craig Barrel Proof more than anything else I could think of - the bold, dark sugars, and barrel char elements specifically.","Even though Brown-Forman is no longer telling us the specifics about the release as of this year, $55 for a bold, complex, 12 year-old limited release is still a bargain.",A barrel of complex flavors hiding amidst a fairly bold and hotter-than-anticipated sip.,"My first few sittings with this bourbon left me wondering what others saw in it, as it made other reviewers’ top 10 lists consistently. It just seemed hot and unbalanced to me, and I often sip barrel proofers in case you were wondering. Despite this, I kept pouring more on different occasions. Over time, I’ve warmed up to this bourbon and recognize that its complexity of flavors are what allow it to shine, albeit hidden behind a fairly hot and somewhat unbalanced sip. For me, this is to bourbon what stout is to beer - rich, deep, and bold in that sense. To appreciate it I had to extend the reaches of my palate in order to dig deeper into the complexities it offers.",Nick,4,3.5,2.5,4,4,3.5,https://www.breakingbourbon.com/review/old-forester-2013-birthday-bourbon
,Old Forester 2014 Birthday Bourbon,Classification: Straight Bourbon,Company: Brown-Forman,Distillery: Brown-Forman Shively Distillery,Released: September 2014,Proof: 97,Age: 12 Years,"Mashbill: Undisclosed (Rumored to be 72% corn, 18% rye, and 10% malted barley)",Color:  Copper,MSRP: $60 (2014),Official Website,"September 2nd marks the birthday of George Garvin Brown, one of the founders of Brown-Forman. To honor him, Brown-Forman released an Old Forester Birthday Bourbon. This bourbon is a special annual release that started in September 2002 and varies year to year based on age, warehouse location, number of barrels used, and so on. The bourbon comes in a special old fashioned glass bottle and is an anticipated release every year in the bourbon community. The 2014 bottling of Old Forester Birthday Bourbon marks the 13th year that Brown-Forman has offered this bourbon.

Like the 2013 edition, this version no longer lists out detailed notes on barrels selected or warehouse location stored.","The nose on the 2014 edition is really fantastic and I found it to be very well balanced. Upon first whiff, you’ll notice that this bourbon leans heavily towards the sweet side. Caramel, vanilla, milk chocolate, maple, and weirdly enough fresh straw scents are all present up front. It’s really a fantastic nose that makes you want to linger on it for a while before tasting the bourbon.","The palate is sweet, but not quite as sweet as the nose may lead you to believe. I found the bourbon to have a rich and creamy mouthfeel with predominant notes of burnt sugar, vanilla, allspice, and a hint of butterscotch. While I didn’t think the palate was quite as good as past editions (2011 and 2012 for example), I still found it very enjoyable and better than many of the recent limited edition releases I’ve tasted this year.","The finish started off dryer and hotter than I expected, especially when you take into account that it’s only a 97 proof bourbon. The heat lingers for a few moments before it fading away to flavors of old wood, vanilla frosting, and a long lasting taste of lightly toasted sugar. It’s not a bad finish per se, but it's definitely the weakest part of the flavor profile on this bourbon.","While no specific details are given on this 2014 edition, once again Brown-Forman delivers a unique bourbon. This edition of the Birthday Bourbon Series reminded me more of the 2011 and 2012 editions versus the 2013 edition. While no aging notes are provided again this year, I would be inclined to say that this was pulled from a different section of the warehouse than where the 2013 edition was aged. This bourbon contained all the sweetness upfront that has defined the Birthday Series, and it delivers an above average and hotter than normal finish.","At $60 this is the most expensive edition of the Birthday Bourbon Series to date. But, it's worth the money. Its great nose and strong flavor profile back up the asking price. And, compared to other brands, this bourbon is still one of the least expensive limited edition releases this year.

While Brown-Forman has been increasing the price by $5 for the past few years, hopefully they cap the price at the $60 mark for another year or two before the next increase. This is a great series, but it would be a shame for them to continue to increase the price without increasing the quality or, at the least, providing the aging notes once again.",A solid dose of sweet upfront with a hotter than expected finish…just the way all Birthdays should be celebrated!,"I’ve said it before and I’ll say it again, but my only real complaint for this series is the bottle design. I realize that Brown-Forman is trying to play up the fact that it's a celebration bottle and brought it to retail in an ""old fashioned"" style bottle. However, it takes up a lot of shelf space and is a pain to pour from, often spilling down the sides. I’m sure the design won’t change anytime soon and I’m sure I won’t stop complaining about the design on future editions.

That being said, the Birthday Series once again delivers a winner. For $60 you get a limited edition release that is just a treat to drink. In years past it always blew my mind that many of these birthday annual releases sat on the shelf for a long time. Clearly the secret is out now that this is a great series, as this was the first year I had to actively hunt down a bottle to add to my collection. If you see a bottle on the shelf of your local liquor store, don’t hesitate to buy it, as it will prove to be money well spent.",Jordan,4.5,3.5,3,3.5,3,3.5,https://www.breakingbourbon.com/review/old-forester-2014-birthday-bourbon
,Old Forester 2016 Birthday Bourbon,Classification: Straight Bourbon,Company: Brown-Forman,Distillery: Brown-Forman Shively Distillery,Released: September 2016,Proof: 97,Age: 12 Years,"Mashbill: Undisclosed (Rumored to be 72% corn, 18% rye, and 10% malted barley)",Color: Copper,MSRP: $80 (2016),Official Website,"September 2nd marks the birthday of George Garvin Brown, one of the founders of Brown-Forman. To honor him, Brown-Forman released an Old Forester Birthday Bourbon. This bourbon is a special annual release that started in September 2002 and varies year to year based on age, warehouse location, number of barrels used, and other various factors. The bourbon comes in a special old fashioned glass bottle and is an anticipated release every year in the bourbon community. This year marks the 15th year that Brown-Forman has offered this bourbon.

For the first time since 2012, Brown-Forman released more detailed information on the barrels selected for this year’s edition. The 2016 release is composed of 93 barrels, resulting in a total of 14,400 bottles being released. This makes 2016 the largest release of Birthday Bourbon ever. The bourbon was originally barreled on June 4, 2004 and aged for 12 years on the 5th floor of Warehouse K. According to Brown-Forman, these barrels were located near a window facing west, allowing them to be sun kissed.","The Birthday Bourbon series has always delivered a delicious nose that you want to linger on, and this year’s edition lives up to the standard set by past editions. A delightfully rich nose reveals upfront scents of honey, vanilla, fresh cut flowers, and a delicious dose of bubble gum. Further nosing reveals delicate notes of aged oak, leather, and a hint of dried golden raisins.","Creamy notes of rich breakfast buns mix with bold citrus flavors and rich oak. All of these flavors mingle together to form a palate on the sweeter side that is delicate, yet full of flavor. This has a lighter mouthfeel that forces you to hunt a little harder for the full picture, but it’s worth the reward. It’s not the deepest palate, but can hold its own in the series, and reminds me a lot of the sweet creamy palate of the 2014 release. It’s a nice improvement over the dry palate found in last year’s bottling.","The finish has all the right ingredients; a dab of tempered heat up front, a nice amount of oak interweaves with a rich syrupy flavoring sprinkled with brown sugar, and a lingering subtle oak taste that lingers for a while. This sounds like it should be a grand slam, but after a complex and rich experience up to this point, the finish seems to fizzle out, versus trying to go out on a high note. This unfortunately seems to be a trend in recent years with the finish being the weakest part of each sip.","I’m happy to see that Brown-Forman brought back more detailed aging notes this year. Marketing mumbo jumbo on “westward facing windows” and “sun kissed” whatnot aside, this earns a unique placement in the series. This is partly due to the fact that it’s the largest release ever, but also for once again delivering a tasty flavor profile that makes you look forward to the next sip. In a year of some mundane releases, the unique nose and palate were refreshing to experience.

The Old Forester Birthday Bourbon series is one that consistently delivers a unique experience that has yet to disappoint me in a given year. While each release is different, such as the drier flavor profile of the 2015 edition or the bold and complex flavor profile of the 2013 edition, they all deliver an experience that never lets me down. A lot of people love consistency in a limited release, and that’s okay. However for this series, the ability to consistently deliver a unique experience is what’s so great in my opinion. It makes me look forward to and wonder what the next year will bring.

I’ve mentioned this every time I’ve reviewed this series before but I’ll say it again, my biggest gripe for this series is the bottle design. I realize that Brown-Forman is trying to play up the fact that it's a celebration bottle and brought it to retail in an ""old fashioned"" style bottle. However, it takes up a lot of shelf space and is a true pain to pour from. I’m sure the design won’t change anytime soon and I’m sure I won’t stop complaining about the design on future editions.","The value conundrum with this bourbon goes far back and returns again this year. Before the bourbon boom hit, this series was reasonably priced at $40 up until 2009. Brown-Forman has capitalized on the bourbon boom and has slowly been raising the price, capping off at $80 for the 2015 edition. While $80 seems like a lot of money for this series considering its past price points, it’s the new norm.

Amazingly enough, even in this booming market, the price for this year’s edition hasn’t gone up and has actually held steady. As the Old Forester Whiskey Row series continues to rise in price with each new release, it’s nice to see the price of the Birthday Bourbon stay the same. Seeing as other limited releases this year, such as the Buffalo Trace Antique Collection, Four Roses 2016 Limited Edition Small Batch, and the Knob Creek 2001 Limited Editions all cost $10-$50 more, this bourbon now seems like a great value. You may not be happy with an $80 price tag, but compared to other releases this year, Brown-Forman is presenting consumers with a more than fair deal.",The Old Forester Birthday Bourbon series is the best example of what Brown-Forman is capable of and this year doesn’t disappoint.,"Another year, and another candle gets added to the cake. While the series still hasn’t been able to get back to its glory days that it saw with the 2011 and 2012 editions, it nonetheless delivers a well rounded experience that should be enjoyable by all. The flavor profile stands apart from other special releases put out in the market this year offering consumers an experience that will reward them for tracking down a bottle. For those fortunate enough to find one on the shelf, make sure to crack this one open as it’s the best bourbon Brown-Forman offers.

,Old Forester 2017 Birthday Bourbon,Classification: Straight Bourbon,Company: Brown-Forman,Distillery: Brown-Forman Shively Distillery,Released: September 2017,Proof: 96 (also released in a 95.4 proof expression),Age: 12 Years,"Mashbill: 72% Corn, 18% Rye, and 10% Malted Barley",Color:  Dark Amber,MSRP: $80 (2017),Official Website,"September 2nd marks the birthday of George Garvin Brown, one of the founders of Brown-Forman. To honor him, Brown-Forman released an Old Forester Birthday Bourbon. This bourbon is a special annual release that started in September 2002 and varies year to year based on age, warehouse location, number of barrels used, and other various factors. The bourbon comes in a special old fashioned glass bottle and is an anticipated release every year in the bourbon community. This year marks the 16th year (17th release, as there were spring and fall releases in 2003) that Brown-Forman has offered this bourbon.

According to the company press release, “The 2017 Birthday Bourbon barrel selection was drawn from a total of 120 12-year old barrels from different warehouses and floors all distilled on May 27, 2005. 93 barrels matured together on the 4th floor of G warehouse, while the remaining 27 barrels matured together on the 5th floor of K warehouse. Several barrels from both lots basked in the sun, highlighting the effects of maturation along an external wall in Old Forester’s heat cycled warehouses. The bottles hold the standard Old Forester mashbill of 72% corn, 18% rye, and 10% barley.”

The press release goes on to say, “For this year’s Birthday Bourbon, science plays an integral role in the product story. During the transfer of Bourbon from the holding tank to the bottling line, alcohol vapors were lost during bottling, causing the proof to drop. As a result, this year’s Birthday Bourbon will be presented at both 96 proof and 95.4 proof.” As far as where the different proofs will be distributed, the press release goes on to say, “Florida and Georgia will receive the 95.4 proof expression and remaining states will receive the 96 proof expression. Kentucky is the only state which will receive both expressions, with the 96 proof expression shipping first.”

While a total bottle count was not provided, using last year’s yield of approximately 155 bottles per barrel results in an estimated total bottle count of 18,600 for 2017’s release. The bourbon in review is from the 96 proof batch.","Burnt caramel, sweet vanilla, and a hint of spice come forward against a backdrop of seasoned oak. I also sense a bit of charred oak, layering in some depth on the nose. It’s a notably delightful aroma, creating a welcoming introduction that entices deeper exploration.","Charred oak and a healthy dose of spice hit first. They’re followed by chocolate, as the bourbon coats the insides of my mouth. As it lingers, there’s a trace of dark fruit, but it’s hidden well behind the initial flavors. It’s very good overall, and at 96 proof the intensity of the flavors is just about right, though there’s a part of me that wants a bit more.","It’s here that I notice how mouth-coating this bourbon is, as the texture lingers intensely after I swallow. It ends with a nice long finish as chocolate, spice, and charred oak taper off. Considering the 96 proof left me wanting a little more on the palate, the finish almost makes up for it with its long lasting presence and lingering mouthfeel.","We’ve reviewed a number of Birthday Bourbons and for me they seem to share deep, rich, chocolate and barrel char flavor characteristics. Typically at 12 years old, this series has enough time to have developed a complex flavor profile, but not necessarily so long that it enters the territory of being over-oaked. This year’s vintage maintains the characteristics that I’m familiar with, and manages to round out some of the rough edges that I’ve noticed in past releases.

Old Forester 1920 Prohibition Style was released last year around the same time as 2016 Old Forester Birthday Bourbon, and has been out long enough to have reached most bourbon enthusiasts. Met with critical acclaim in many cases, the burning question on my mind was how this premium release within the same brand compared with this year’s Birthday Bourbon. To put it bluntly, I like 1920 a bit better. But I think 1920 really pulls ahead as a result of its nearly 20 additional proof points, not necessarily because its flavor profile is just that much better. Considering Birthday Bourbon’s characteristically rich, chocolatey, barrel char flavor profile, which is really good at 96 proof, it seems like it would be fantastic at a higher proof. Knowing just how good 1920 is at its 115 proof, I’d really like to see a limited run of specially selected barrels with Birthday Bourbon’s flavor characteristics released at barrel proof.","This year’s edition comes in at the same price as last year’s, $80. It’s a good price for an established limited release from a major distillery in today’s market, and as a result nearly impossible to find without a retailer connection, a bit of luck, or some extra money to throw at it in the secondary market (or at retailer markup). Last year’s bottles of Birthday Bourbon commanded the mid $100’s to as much as mid $200’s in the secondary, which isn’t nearly as outrageous as other limited release bottlings but still in excess of what the bourbon inside the bottle warrants.

Considering you can find 1920 Prohibition Style, which is a better bourbon produced by the same company for less money and significantly less stress, the only real reason to get your hands on Birthday Bourbon is because you just feel you have to have a bottle. I would buy it at MSRP or a bit more just because it’d be too hard to resist and the price is reasonable, but much more than that I would have doubts. Fortunately, we estimate a larger bottle count than last year - 18,600 up from 14,400 (a 29% increase), so finding a bottle should be a little easier.","2017 Old Forester Birthday Bourbon is an exemplary release for the brand, showcasing flavors and rounding out rough edges, all the while leaving me wanting a higher proof.","Established limited releases from major brands bring with them an expectation of greatness. For fans of Birthday Bourbon, the 2017 bottling will not disappoint. It exemplifies the characteristics of the brand and rounds out what have been some rough edges I’ve noticed with past releases, all the while not sacrificing flavor. For others, it’s one of the better vintages I can remember and I think makes it worthy of your attention. Old Forester is one of those brands that bourbon drinkers seem to love or hate, and with the successful Whiskey Row series it seems more have been pulled over to appreciate the flavor characteristics of the brand when they’re delivered in a quality way. With that in mind, 2017 Birthday Bourbon will be rather difficult to find anywhere near MSRP, so if you can’t get your hands on it, find solace in the fact that you can find an even better bourbon from the same distillery and for less money with 1920 Prohibition Style.

,Old Forester 2018 Birthday Bourbon,Classification: Straight Bourbon,Company: Brown-Forman,Distillery: Brown-Forman Shively Distillery,Released: September 2018,Proof: 101,Age: 12 Years,"Mashbill: Undisclosed (Previous releases were 72% Corn, 18% Rye, and 10% Malted Barley",Color:  Deep Copper,MSRP: $100 (2018),Official Website,"The 2018 release of Old Forester Birthday Bourbon marks the 18th release of the series. Its 101 proof is the series’ highest proof to date. The 2018 edition is comprised of 120 barrels, which according to Brown-Forman consists of 93 barrels matured together on the 3rd floor, on the Northwest side of Warehouse J. The remaining 27 barrels matured together on the 3rd floor, on the Northwest side of Warehouse I.

This year’s bottling had an unusually low yield of just 39%, and 5 barrels were actually found to be empty, resulting in 14,400 bottles being released. This is also the first time the series was bottled at the the new Old Forester Distilling Co., located in downtown Louisville.","The slight bump in proof this year really shines through right from the beginning. Rich and deep, the nose on this year's edition continues the tradition of this series delivering a great experience. Sweet dark berries, caramel, brown sugar, and oak make for a dynamic mixture that impresses from first whiff. Beneath these scents lies a slight hint of spice, which blends nicely into the overall experience.","The sip itself is less viscous than one would expect after the rich nose. Despite the thinner mouthfeel, the sweet flavors still carry over nicely from the nose. Dark berries appear again and are joined by vanilla, baking chocolate, rye grain, and light oak. While good, the palate leaves you wishing that all the flavors had just a bit more of a pop than what they actually deliver.","The finish starts with a a touch of heat. Caramel, light oak, tobacco leaves, green pepper, and rye spice are predominant. The caramel and rye spice eventually drop off, leaving a pleasant mixture of oak and tobacco leaves. This finish lingers for a surprisingly lengthy amount of time.","Birthday Bourbon always has a distinct flavor profile from the rest of the Old Forester line. Aged longer than its siblings, the additional time in wood allows it to acquire a richer flavor profile that is distinctly different from the rest of the Old Forester lineup. It may not deliver the boldest experience of the lineup thanks to the ongoing release of Old Forester 1920, but the series delivers a rich experience that has yet to be duplicated in an ongoing Old Forester release.

The proof increase this year is a welcome sight. It doesn’t have as large of an impact on the depth of the palate as I was hoping for, but it nicely enhances both the nose and the finish. It’s a trend I’d like to see continue in future additions.","Over the last number of years, Brown-Forman has slowly been raising the price of their Old Forester Birthday Bourbon series. While the price held steady in 2017, it jumps up $20 this year marking the first time that the series hits the $100 mark. This now makes it the highest priced product bearing the Old Forester name. This also aligns it with the price point that Brown-Forman usually charges for their Woodford Master’s Collection products.

It can be painful to realize that this product cost almost half of its current MSRP just five years ago. However, many product's prices have increased steadily over the years, and it’s now commonplace for limited release products to be priced at $100 or more. Given this year’s flavor profile, the $20 price increase is hard to complain about, since the whiskey delivers an experience that matches many of the great limited offerings we’ve experienced in 2018.","Even with an increase in price, this year’s edition of Birthday Bourbon is worth the price of admission.","This year’s Birthday Bourbon is once again a solid performer. The nose is as satisfying as ever, and the finish lasts longer than most other bottles on the market. While the palate leaves me wanting a little more pop, the sip as a whole is really great. It doesn’t quite live up to the fantastic 2011 and 2012 editions of years past, but it certainly delivers a satisfying experience as the past few editions have.

It wouldn’t be a proper Birthday Bourbon review if I didn’t mention my disdain for the bottle design used in this series. I realize that Brown-Forman is trying to play up the fact that it's a celebration bottle in an ""old fashioned"" style bottle. However, it takes up a lot of shelf space and is problematic to pour from, often spilling down the sides. I’ve given up hoping for a design change anytime soon, but that doesn’t make me wonder every year if there isn’t a better consumer friendlier compromise they could come to

In the end though, it doesn’t really matter what the bottle shape is. The bourbon is great, and worth its asking price. The biggest shame is how few folks will stumble upon one in a store. For those that do though, make sure to open this one up as you’re in for a treat.

,Old Forester Statesman Bourbon,Classification: Straight Bourbon,Company: Brown-Forman,Distillery: Old Forester Distilling Company,Release Date: July 2017 (Ongoing release),Proof: 95,Age: NAS,"Mashbill: 72% Corn, 18% Rye, 10% Malted Barley",Color: Light Mahogany,Price: $55 (2020),Official Website,"Old Forester Statesman was originally released as a tie-in with the 2017 movie, Kingsman: The Gold Circle. Where many tie-ins are often limited time offerings, Old Forester has kept Statesman on as a permanent line expression. It is a no age statement bourbon, but at the time of its initial release, it was said that it contained bourbon under 5 years old. According to Old Forester’s website, Statesman is a blend of hand-selected casks from the warmest places in their warehouse.","An extremely bright and sweet aroma puts you under its spell with its fusion of cherry, brown sugar, vanilla, sugar cookie, and seasoned oak. It has a surprising intensity for its proof, yet manages to be well-rounded with its fragrances. The scents work acutely well together and produce an aroma that is all-too-hard to resist.","The whiskey immediately comes out of the gate making a positive impression with its sweet and fruity flavors. Cherry, confectioners’ sugar, cocoa, light banana, and caramel combine to create a robust and delectable experience. The flavors work well together, and while they don’t make the flavor palate overly complex on its surface, they work in tandem with its proof to create an excellent easy-sipping bourbon.  ","The heat gently ramps up during the sips finish and highlights its cinnamon and oaky side. It unfortunately features Old Forester’s typical funky aftertaste, but in this case it’s thankfully mild, fleeting, and largely inconsequential. Forgoing the majority of the palate’s sweeter notes during its finish helps create an overall balanced tasting experience, which allows its oakiness to help ground this bourbon before its done.","Old Forester offers a range of different proof bourbons that all share the same mashbill. While this gives drinkers the options of choosing the proof they prefer, it also doesn’t provide a lot of flavor variation within the brand’s portfolio. This is especially true at the lower end of the proof spectrum.

This includes Old Forester Bourbon at 86 proof, Old Forester 1870 at 90 proof, Old Forester 1910 Fine Whisky at 92 proof, Old Forester Statesman at 95 proof, Old Forester Signature at 100 proof, Old Forester 1897 Bottled in Bond at 100 proof, and in 2020, an expanded single barrel program with a 100 proof option. That’s a lot of bourbons within a small range of proof that all share the same mashbill. So what makes Statesman stand out from the rest of them?

Statesman is by far the sweetest and fruitiest of the aforementioned bourbons, and also has the least amount of oakiness. There are definitely bourbon drinkers that don’t like overly fruity and sweet-forward bourbons, and for them I would direct them to Signature, with the Single Barrel, 1870, and 1897 following in between. 1910 might be the best of both worlds with its second barreling in a lightly toasted, heavily charred barrel producing a bourbon that’s sickly sweet and heavily oaked.

For those who do enjoy sweet bourbon, Statesman is one of Old Forester’s sweetest and fruitiest bourbons across their entire portfolio. Being a blend from hand-selected casks this must be the flavor profile they are striving for. This puts it in competition with some other brands, most notably with select Four Roses, Wild Turkey, and Knob Creek single barrels that can find themselves in this particular fruity and/or sweet style. With those being single barrels along with plenty of other limited edition bourbons that often aim for this agreeable flavor profile, they aren’t always readily available. Statesman on the other hand is a non-limited edition ongoing release, and usually found without a ton of effort. It’s not that there isn’t shortage of sweet bourbon on the market, it’s just that this one does it so well.","Statesman’s $55 price falls in line with a number of sweet and fruit-forward bourbons. Like the aforementioned select single barrels from Knob Creek ($45), Wild Turkey ($55), Four Roses ($75+), and other examples like Henry McKenna Single Barrel ($45+), Blanton’s Single Barrel ($55+), I.W. Harper 15 Year ($85), Statesman at $55 falls in nicely in the middle of the pack. Statesman doesn’t seem to see the same demand as Old Forester’s Whiskey Row bourbons, and is often available to stores that want to carry it. I also have the strange feeling that if any other large Kentucky distillery put this same product out as a limited edition, with its drinkability and sweet/fruit profile, there would be more hype surrounding it. While it doesn’t feature the same complexity as some bourbons, it is hard to argue against how important drinkability is to this bourbon's overall impact. At $55 and wide availability, Statesman is a decent value through and through.","Old Forester Statesman forgoes some complexity in exchange for pure drinkability, yet easily justifies its price as a readily available and under-the-radar bourbon.","For fans of sweet and fruity bourbons, Old Forester Statesman is going to be hard to resist. There are plenty of bourbons that strive to achieve this goal, but few that really nail it. In my own personal sweet and fruity bourbon pantheon, it falls right in with I.W. Harper 15 Year, Barterhouse, and even some older Wild Turkey bourbons. Brown-Forman might have had some lows with their Old Forester bourbons over the last decade, but the entire brand continues to see improvements, and their Birthday Bourbon and King of Kentucky remain some of the top bourbons released in a given year. What really makes Statesman even more surprising is it's not a limited edition release or wallet-breaking either. It’s simply an easy-to-enjoy bourbon that beautifully showcases what Brown-Forman can produce.",Eric,4,4,3,3,3,3.5,https://www.breakingbourbon.com/review/old-forester-statesman-bourbon
,Old Weller Antique Bourbon,Classification: Straight Bourbon,"Company: Sazerac Company, Inc.",Distillery: Buffalo Trace,Released: Ongoing,Proof: 107,Age: NAS (Said to be around 7 years),Mashbill: Undisclosed,Color:  Deep Amber,MSRP: $30 (2016),Official Website,,"There’s a lot of spice that immediately hits your nose, with subtle hints of vanilla, caramel and butterscotch. Deeper, the nose has whiffs of leather and nutmeg with trace amounts of cinnamon. Most surprising is the amount of oak that comes off of it for a relatively young bourbon. Smell long enough and faint sweet barbecue notes pull out.",It comes off a bit thin at first but then a tidal wave of flavor and heat hit that even affects your nose. It feels like you’re sipping a barrel proof bourbon without the high proof attached to it. It has moments of sweetness mixed in that is countered with an alcohol bite.  A hot and full flavor affair.,"This where the oak shines through. A delicious combination of char and spice that doesn’t overstay its welcome. The wheat sweetness is still present, but a measured blast of heat will let you know it’s there as it goes down. The semi dry finish isn’t overly complex but it has a decent amount of weight to it that helps balance the whole package.","Besides being one of the few wheated bourbons on the marketplace, oak verses age is the name of the game here. It's age falls around the 7 year range and has more oak flavor than many similar aged bottles on sale today. Whatever magic Buffalo Trace uses to accomplish this certainly make it unique to Weller Antique. The nose on each of the W.L. Weller bourbons (12 Year, Special Reserve, Antique) are  surprisingly great. Combined with a robust palate, Weller Antique is easily comparable to bourbons twice its price.","Again and again, the W.L. Weller line is one of the best values in bourbon. Old Weller Antique tastes like a bourbon that is much older than it is and can even taste a lot like a barrel proof bourbon. All of this with a MSRP under $25.

This is also a bourbon that shares the same mashbill, warehouse and proof as Old Rip Van Winkle 10 year. Given the choice, I would always choose Old Weller Antique. Its younger age maintains a more agreeable amount of oak and has a price point that is easy of the wallet.",A full spicy flavor at a nice proof and price.,"As with most things in life, it’s about putting it into perspective. People see high marks for the Weller line, try it and aren’t immediately blown away. Old Weller Antique, like its other Weller brothers, are surprisingly complex bourbons for their age and price. Sometimes you might have to spend a few extra minutes and sips to fully appreciate what the Weller brand offers. Old Weller Antique because of its spice and heat may not be for everyone. But if you're looking for a bourbon with a little more kick without getting into very high proof bourbons then this is a great place to start.",Eric,3,3,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,https://www.breakingbourbon.com/review/old-weller-antique-bourbon
,Parker's Heritage Collection: Bourbon Finished in Orange Curaçao Barrels,Classification: Straight Bourbon,Company: Heaven Hill,Distillery: Heaven Hill,Released: September 2018,Proof: 110,Age: 7-8 Years,"Mashbill: 78% Corn, 12% Malted Barley, 10% Rye",Color:  Copper,MSRP: $90 (2018),Official Website,"This is the 12th edition of the annual Parker’s Heritage Collection (PHC). For this edition, the bourbon was aged seven to eight years in the upper floors of Rickhouse Q, then finished for four months in barrels that previously held French Orange Curaçao liqueur. This is the second barrel-finished bourbon in the collection, following in the steps of the 5th Edition Cognac finished Kentucky Straight Bourbon Whiskey. Once again, a portion of the proceeds from each bottle sold will be contributed to the ALS Association.","Traditional bourbon notes of vanilla and caramel upfront that are quickly washed over with a wave of orange soda, candied fruits, and mild barrel char. Its medium intensity of aromas are a bit strange at first, yet not alarmingly so, as the orange notes are certainly unique and welcoming. It’s worth pointing out that its aromas intensify in a more open air glass than a traditional glencairn. Something I haven’t noticed with other bourbons to this degree.","A flash of orange marmalade, orange sponge candy, slight bitterness, and sugary alcoholic bite instantly reminds me of Grand Marnier. Seasoned oak and hearty vanilla notes roll in, bumping out the majority of the Orange Curaçao barrel finish. It’s an enjoyable mingling that I can’t help but feelis a little too short and lacking complexity.","Seasoned oak and vanilla notes carry over into the finish and dominate. Sugary orange notes weave throughout, but struggle to really pop. As the heartier bourbon and barrel notes subside, orange marmalade becomes more noticeable again and nicely caps this bourbon off.","It’s hard to discuss this barrel finish without mentioning Willett XCF V1.0. Released in 2015, XCF was a 103 proof, 7 year old rye finished in orange curaçao barrels for approximately 90 days. With similar ages both in their base whiskeys and their finishing time, it’s interesting how different XCF and Parker’s are from each other.

XCF comes off as a bottled old fashioned cocktail in many ways. The Orange Curaçao notes pop and do well mingling with its rye base. The XCF’s age and lack of barrel notes helps brighten its barrel influence more so than the Parker’s. Yet, it also lacks depth and makes you wonder if Orange Curaçao barrels have this effect on all whiskeys or if these whiskeys just weren’t finished long enough.

In the end, tasting a whiskey with orange flavor notes really stands out. A whiskey might sport minor orange notes from time to time, but none to the degree that XCF and Parker’s showcase. Orange can be an overpowering flavor and it must take a ton of skill to nail it just right. Thankfully this edition of Parker’s does a good job controlling the intensity of its orange flavor without letting it do just that. Where the rye and orange notes were playful with each other in the XCF, the bourbon notes of the Parker’s helps ground this whiskey. It’s hard to say which is the better route to take, but quit easy to revel in its uniqueness.","With Parker’s fluctuating in pricing over the last few years, it’s nice to see this priced under $100 again this year. I get the sense that sourcing Orange Curaçao barrel isn’t cheap or easy. For one, XCF was priced at $140 in 2015, and two, XCF was the last Orange Curaçao barrel finished whiskey to come to market since its release. $90 still might be a high asking price for a type of barrel finished whiskey that doesn’t have a long proven track record, but you never get the sense that Heaven Hill uses subpar whiskey in these releases. Even though we haven’t loved every Parker’s release, we’ve never claimed any were straight up bad either. This year’s Parker’s has a solid bourbon as its base in addition to its unique barrel finish, all for the same price the company charged for a Parker’s release in 2014.",A unique barrel finish that mingles orange notes with traditional bourbon flavors to interesting and largely satisfying results.,"The Parker’s Heritage Collection is full of surprises. Few could have predicted this year’s direction Heaven Hill took with it. Willett’s XCF was an interesting concept that begged further exploration, yet no one ran with it. By using bourbon instead of rye like XCF used, Heaven Hill showed how Orange Curaçao barrel finishing can have different effects on different types of whiskeys. The release isn’t without its faults, mainly its lack of complexity. It simply begs further exploration of this type of barrel finish. The orange focused flavor profile won’t be for everyone as it’s out of the ordinary, but that’s exactly what this Collection does best. It explores whiskey’s otherworldly avenues and untraveled paths. XCF wasn’t a homerun when it was released, but plenty of whiskey drinkers regret not jumping on it when they had the chance. I predict a similar thing happening with this Parker’s release, as it tends to happen with every Parker’s release. With a reasonable price and a solid overall barrel finish, this release is worth the trek.

,Parker's Heritage Collection: 11 Year Single Barrel,Classification: Straight Bourbon,Company: Heaven Hill,Distillery: Heaven Hill,Released: October 2017,Proof: 122,Age: 11 Years,"Mashbill: 78% Corn, 12% Malted Barley, 10% Rye",Color:  Copper,MSRP: $130 (2017),Official Website,"This is the 11th yearly edition of the Parker’s Heritage Collection (PHC). This edition is an 11 year old bourbon released in single barrel form. According to the company, it showcases what Parker Beam felt was one of his greatest achievements throughout his more than 50 years of distilling experience – the introduction of Heaven Hill’s single barrel bourbons. It was aged in Parker’s favorite rickhouse location in Deatsville, KY. The bottle being reviewed is from barrel #4716496, rickhouse DD, floor 2, rick 86.","A potent yet still somewhat understated nose for a 122 proof bourbon. Bountiful notes of tobacco, raisins, caramel, and cherry make this bourbon a delight to nose. Trace amounts of ethanol and bitterness are also present, but are overpowered by heavier oak notes. It’s certainly an enjoyable nose, but there is something about it that makes it come up a little short. It just might be that the combination of them doesn’t quite mingle together perfectly or as well as they should.","Heavy notes of oak, tobacco, and cinnamon come blasting to the forefront of the sip. The proof is evident, as a strong blast of heat comes immediately. After the heat subsides, a creamy consistency materializes along with faint notes of candy corn, baking spice, and fireball candy. It leans more on pomp and circumstance than delicate and sophisticated.","It’s a bit baffling and surprising how straightforward this finish is coming from a Parker’s release. Heavy notes of oak dominate with a healthy amount of dryness. It’s a bit too powerful tasting for its own good, as too many of the palate’s flavors get completely drowned out by the heat in the finish. Adding water helps tame the heat, but does little to enhance the flavor.","Heaven Hill manages to release a notably different Parker’s Heritage Collection product every year, yet they never get labeled as “experimental” or “gimmicky.” A lot of this has to do with the Collection being grounded in types of releases you might see from any other distillery, except Parker’s has an incredible track record that few in the industry can match.

At one time, an 11 year old bourbon was nothing special. Nowadays as age statements have all but disappeared, it can be easily considered a special release. Many of Parker’s releases fall under the “don’t judge a book by its cover” category. On paper they seem like nothing special. It’s not until you try them that the bigger picture is revealed. This year’s Parker’s flavor profile isn’t revolutionary, but it isn’t boring either. It’s somewhere in the middle and that has worked for the series before. Usually this is saved by the fact that Parker’s is routinely an very-above-average tasting product. That’s partly true this year too, but for once I’m not sure if it’s enough. It does have a interesting mingling of flavors and the quality is there, but it doesn’t quite come together as well as it should.","Year after year Parker’s tends to be priced right on the pulse of what limited editions should be priced at. That hasn’t always been the case for consumers. Take for example the last five releases. Plenty complained about $80 for 2012’s Blend of Mashbills, $90 for 2013’s Promise of Hope and 2014’s Wheat Whiskey, $100 for 2015’s Malt Whiskey, and $250 for 2016’s 24 Year Bottled In Bond Bourbon. You might not have been willing to pay MSRP for those whiskeys at the time, but in hindsight they all come across as pretty reasonably priced.

This year’s Parker’s at $130 for an 11 year old single barrel bourbon seems a bit excessive for anyone who has been drinking bourbon for more than a few years. Much like the response Promise of Hope received for being a 10 year old single barrel bourbon, it seems like a high price to pay for what the label says. In Promise of Hope’s case, what was in the bottle certainly warranted its price. Unfortunately, I can’t say the same thing about this 11 Year. It’s higher proof combined with the Collection’s track record provided hope, but ultimately it suffers the same fate as many recent limited edition bourbons over the past year or two - what’s in the bottle just isn’t all that magical. Yes the 11 Year is a good bourbon, but much like the reception Knob Creek and Wild Turkey received with their special editions over the past few years, it’s just not good enough to warrant the price or memorable enough to make you want to revisit it over and over.","The 11th edition of Parker’s Heritage Collection has its moments, but a combination of high heat, a bit too straightforwardness, and a $130 price tag quickly fanned my excitement for it.","Despite many factors pointing to this potentially being Promise of Hope Part 2 at 122 proof, it simply didn’t pan out. Tasting them side by side (and even adding some water to the 11 Year) it’s immediately clear they aren’t the same bourbon or even bourbons on the same level. With that expectation out of the way, the 11th edition is still a solid bourbon and there are definitely some aspects to like about it. But based on the brand’s track record and price tag this year, this edition might be a harder sell for some and ended up being a disappointment for me. It’s lacking that immediate Parker’s magic and instead requires the drinker to do a bit more dissecting to really get the most out of it.

Being a single barrel, experiences will vary but that’s usually something you haven’t ever had to worry about with Parker’s single barrels. I tasted two different barrels of this year’s release side by side, and there wasn’t a drastic difference in overall quality. In fact, the other barrel wasn’t as good as the one I’m reviewing. Overall opinions of this release do seem to vary greatly (especially from reviews based on media samples), so maybe you’ll have to ultimately judge for yourself. Where past editions used to be true standouts in their given years, the 11th edition runs the real risk of blending in with the many other forgettable limited editions in 2017.",Eric,3.5,3.5,2.5,2.5,2,3.5,https://www.breakingbourbon.com/review/parkers-heritage-collection-11-year-single-barrel
,Parker's Heritage Collection: Malt Whiskey,Classification: Straight Malt Whiskey,Company: Heaven Hill,Distillery: Heaven Hill,Released: September 2015,Proof: 108,Age: 8 Years,"Mashbill: 65% Malted Barley, 35% Corn",Color:  Mahogany,MSRP: $100 (2015),Official Website,"This is the 9th yearly edition of the Parker’s Heritage Collection (PHC). This year’s release consisted of 141 barrel batch. We estimate 18,469 bottles produced, which would make it the largest PHC release yet. For every bottle sold, Heaven Hill will contribute $5 to ALS research and treatment in honor of Parker Beam.","A gentle mix of maple, leather, and pine lie underneath an umbrella of pronounced oak. It’s surprising how much oak is coming off of the nose for a whiskey that’s been aged 8 years. At the same time, I don’t feel it overshadows any of the other aromas. In fact, they all mingle quite well. Much of this has to do with the oak having a cool, almost mintiness to it. This creates an interesting effect of the oak notes being strong, yet mellow at the same time. This is definitely one of the more unique noses on a whiskey I’ve smelled in some time.","If you haven't had a lot of experience with American malt whiskeys, this one might be a little bit of a shock for you. While it has flavor similarities to bourbon, there’s no confusing the two. Light notes of toffee and butterscotch are present alongside notes of grass and cedar. Even though the mashbill consists of 65% malt, the sweetness from the corn still pulls through. This creates an interesting interplay between the sweet and oak notes. Overall the palate’s flavors are on the mellow side, which makes it very drinkable, though I do wish it had more richness in its flavors. It might not be a very complex palate, but all of the flavors do an ample job of standing out on their own.","At 108 proof, the finish is surprisingly smooth and very drinkable. It rapidly expands and contracts in your mouth and then lingers for a good amount of time afterwards. Oak once again dominates, but the other flavors from the palate blend together and help counter the oak’s at-times brashness. This is everything Forged Oak wanted to be but failed to deliver. It’s a nice oak-foward finish with just the right amount of accompanying flavors to produce a satisfying conclusion.","There aren’t many American distilleries releasing malt whiskeys in the States with Stranahan’s and Balcones being the most well known. More often than not they are from craft distilleries trying to make a name for themselves by releasing a unique product to the market. The main complaints levied against them are the whiskeys’ young ages, lack of developed palate, and inadequate oak notes in their flavor profiles.

When Heaven Hill announced earlier in the year that the next release in their celebrated Parker’s Heritage Collection would be a malt whiskey, it was certainly a shock to most. Many enthusiasts expected this next iteration to be a rye whiskey, as the collection is known for variations on the company's existing products. So to have one of Kentucky’s big boy distilleries announce a malt whiskey, it was instantly greeted with puzzlement and worry that this year’s bottle wouldn’t live up to the collection’s high standards.

If American malt whiskey makers use this year’s Parker’s release as a benchmark for their own products, whiskey drinkers will have a lot to celebrate. This is one of the more genuinely unique products to come out on the American market in some time. A lot of this currently has to do with the lack of depth in this particular market segment. There’s simply not a lot of high(er) aged American malt whiskeys for sale. Having a mashbill consisting of 65% malt and 35% corn also provides a best of both worlds flavor profile that will taste familiar and unusual at the same time. When you then include the whiskey’s intriguing interplay of sweet and oak notes that also mixes in earthy and minty notes, it’s hard to say you’ve tasted anything like it.","The Parker’s Heritage Collection is hands down one of the most interesting releases each year. You may not love every single release, but the company makes it very hard to complain about the overall quality. I never get the feeling with this collection that I’m paying to taste test an experiment some master distiller came up with on a whim. There have been too many products over the past few years that felt like they were in-house experiments that should have never seen the retail shelves. You may not love every Parker’s Heritage Collection release, but you’d be hard pressed to call them subpar in the quality department.

That said, the brand’s $100 MSRP is right on the money as what these releases should cost. Depending on how much you love the individual release, you either feel like you got your money’s worth or you simply don’t care for the particular release. Never do you feel like you got ripped off with a Parker’s Heritage Collection special release, and that’s a rarity these days. With many of the American malt whiskeys on the market falling in the $50-$75 range and aged 2-5 years, the price for this Parker’s release is certainly within the realm of acceptability, especially when you factor in its age and overall quality.","While this easy to drink malt whiskey lacks a certain refinement and balance, if this is where the American malt whiskey market is headed, full steam ahead.","This year’s Parker’s Heritage Collection release isn’t just a slight variation of another whiskey you’ve had. It genuinely tastes different than what’s currently being offered on the market and will therefore have a hard time being loved universally among whiskey enthusiasts.  Every few years the Parker’s Heritage Collection throws a curveball. The 5th Edition Cognac Finish and the 6th Edition Blend of Mashbills can both be considered oddballs in the collection. Many will also see this year’s edition as an oddity, but that’s what’s always great about this collection. This is experimentation with a purpose. Year after year the Parker’s Heritage Collection is a high quality product that can be a bit unpredictable in nature, but always worth the trip.

While this year’s edition didn’t blow me away like previous years, I’m having a hard time putting my glass down. The whiskey has a pleasant amount of oak influence that isn’t too dry and its sweet side does a good job helping to add some depth and balance. It’s not perfect, but its smoothness goes a long way trying to convince you otherwise.",Eric,3.5,3.5,3.5,4.5,3,3.5,https://www.breakingbourbon.com/review/parkers-heritage-collection-malt-whiskey
,Pikesville Rye 6 Year,Classification: Straight Rye,Company: Heaven Hill,Distillery: Bernheim Distillery,Released: Ongoing,Proof: 110,Age: 6 Year,"Mashbill: 51% Rye, 39% Corn, 10% Malted Barley",Color: Copper,MSRP: $50 (2016),Official Website,"Pikesville Rye holds the title as the last standing Maryland rye brand. Originally produced in Maryland by L. Winand & Brothers Distillery starting in 1895, the brand went through several changes of ownership, and was last produced in Maryland in 1972 by the Majestic Distilling Corporation. After Majestic Distilling closed, there were still enough whiskey stocks available to keep the brand going until 1982 when it was sold to Heaven Hill. Pikesville Straight Rye Whiskey was brought to market in 2015 and is currently produced at the Bernheim Distillery. Pikesville Straight Rye Whiskey should not be confused with Heaven Hill’s Pikesville Supreme Rye Whiskey, which is currently marketed and sold as a three year old 80 proof rye whiskey in the Maryland market.","A nice mix of sweet and spicy. Cherry syrup, rye spice, red licorice and cinnamon apple float up from the glass. There’s a hint of ethanol present that reminds me this is 110 proof, however it doesn’t distract from the experience. Instead, all of the flavors co-mingle nicely and produce a very satisfying nose.","Cherry is the name of the game with this palate. Cherry cola is immediately present along with the cherry syrup from the nose. Layered beneath are hints of rye spice, vanilla, and summer fruits. This is a rye that’s easy to sip due to its sweeter flavor profile and due to the fact that it tends to drink at a lower proof than it actually is. It’s not the most complex rye out there, but it has a really enjoyable palate that had me going back for more and more.","Rye spice, vanilla, and cherry are immediately noticeable. Upfront the finish contains a nice amount of heat that slowly expands and creeps its way down my throat. As the finish lingers on, a subtle amount of oak makes its way forward along with that familiar cherry syrup taste that’s present in the nose and palate. While not very complex, it provides a nice pleasant endcap.","The fairest comparison to this rye is with its little brother, Rittenhouse Bottled-in-Bond. Many people theorize that Pikesville is Rittenhouse Bottled-in-Bond Rye that has been aged an extra two years and bottled at an additional 10 proof points. This would explain the slight similarity in fruitiness experienced in both, but that’s where the similarities end. While they both may potentially share the same mash bill, Pikesville delivers a whole new unique flavor profile that to me, is more enjoyable than Rittenhouse. This isn’t to say that Rittenhouse is lacking, instead it speaks to the fact that Pikesville builds off of Rittenhouse’s foundation and takes it to the next level.

Pikesville’s true uniqueness comes into play by the fact that it fills in a hole in the marketplace. Bourbon drinkers have been spoiled over the last few years with the outstanding selection of options we have in the marketplace, especially when it comes to higher proof whiskeys. However, up until now there hasn’t been a greater than 100 proof rye that is easily accessible and available year round. The key word being accessible and available year round. While Redemption Rye produces a barrel proof version of their rye and Buffalo Trace produces Thomas Handy, neither is easily accessible throughout the year.","Pikesville comes in at double the price of Rittenhouse Bottled-in-Bond. While this is a steep price to pay for what is essentially two additional aging years and 10 additional proof points, Pikesville does deliver a more refined experience. This is not a knock against Pikesville, but more of a nod to Rittenhouse Bottled-in-Bond for being a fine rye in and of itself at a really affordable price point.

The thing about the rye marketplace is that it’s easy for a product to carve out its niche even in a price range where there’s competition. And Pikesville does face some competition in this price range from other quality ryes such as High West’s Rendezvous Rye, Double Rye barrel aged variants and even E.H. Taylor Rye. While these ryes might offer more complexity and depth, what Pikesville brings to the table is a really easy to drink, full-flavored rye with a less polarizing flavor profile than others in the category. Even in the oversaturated world of bourbons this is a hard quality to find, with a comparable example being Blanton’s Single Barrel bourbon. In fact, in a way, Pikesville does for ryes what Blanton’s Single Barrel does for bourbons; high quality, mass appeal, decent accessibility at a fair price.","Pikesville finally fills a gap in the marketplace by being a readily available, easy to drink high proof rye with mass appeal that deserves a spot on everyone’s must try list.","This is a fantastic addition to Heaven Hill’s rye lineup. While the proof is high, it serves to amplify the fantastic flavor profile rather than impose a lot of burn, making it very enjoyable neat. Additionally, while Pikesville contains a more fruit-forward flavor profile due to the fact that this is most likely a barely-legal rye, the high yet manageable proof helps add to the illusion that  this is a spicier rye than it really is. This should allow both bourbon lovers and hardcore rye lovers alike to appreciate it. On paper this may seem simplistic in nature, but in execution, this is one of the best everyday ryes you can currently find on the shelf. Don’t hesitate to give this premium rye a try.",Jordan,3,4,3.5,3.5,3,3.5,https://www.breakingbourbon.com/review/pikesville-rye-6-year
,Rock Hill Farms Single Barrel Bourbon,Classification: Straight Bourbon,"Company: Sazerac Company, Inc.",Distillery: Buffalo Trace,Release Date: Ongoing,Proof: 100,Age: NAS,"Mashbill: Undisclosed (Buffalo Trace's Mashbill #2, 12-15% rye)",Color: Copper,MSRP: $60,Website,"Named for the rich farmland along the Kentucky River, Rock Hill Farms is part of Buffalo Trace’s Bourbon Mashbill #2 family. With the exception of Ancient Age, Mashbill #2 based bourbons are currently composed of only single barrel offerings. Rock Hill Farms was the highest proof Mashbill #2 bourbon sold in the United States, until in 2020 when it was eclipsed by Blanton’s Gold as the highest proof Mashbill #2 bourbon.","The nose opens with light summer cherries, berries, baked apples, and light hay. Behind these scents is a delicious bed of vanilla, cinnamon bark, and charred oak. For a 100 proof bourbon there isn’t a hint of ethanol, which allows you to concentrate wholey on the scents that are present without being distracted. The mix between more traditional scents and lighter summer fruits strikes a nice balance and a really inviting way to start the sip.","Light spice mixes with a creamy dose of leather and oak. Swirling the sip pulls forward sweeter flavors of allspice, vanilla sticks, toasted sugar, and a light hint of cocktail cherries. The creamieness found at the start of the sip really elevates this palate, resulting in a fantastic flavor profile that keeps pulling you back in for more.","A large dose of rye spice opens up the finish. This spice is joined with hints of creamy vanilla, evergreen, and oak. The rye spice is the constant, as a long lingering combo of toasted oak and rye spice hangs on. While the finish doesn’t quite match the depth that the palate brings, it still allows the sip to end the sip on a memorable note.","Rock Hill Farms is part of the ever-popular Buffalo Trace Mashbill #2 single barrel bourbons. This includes Elmer T. Lee Single Barrel, Blanton’s Single Barrel, and the recently announced stateside release of Blanton’s Gold Single Barrel. The two main differentiators between all of these single barrels are their varying proof along with varying warehouse aging locations.

It’s interesting to see Buffalo Trace release so many single barrel bourbons with such small varying proofs between them all. In theory this should produce similar flavor profiles that are either bolder or weaker based on the proof, however it isn’t an apples to apples comparison across the board. The only line this really works for is Blanton’s, and that’s because that family line is aged in Warehouse H, while the others are aged in different warehouses.

A closer comparison would be Rock Hill Farms to Elmer T. Lee Single Barrel. What comes to light are two different flavor profiles that allow both to shine equally, yet in different ways. Rock Hill Farms shines in its balanced blend of spice with creamy flavors that intermingle into a delicious tasting sip. This combination allows Rock Hill Farms to distinguish itself among it’s Mashbill #2 siblings in its own right.","Rock Hill Farms, like so many of Buffalo Trace’s bourbons, isn’t easy to find at MSRP. As is the case with many Buffalo Trace products, this usually sells for much more on shelves and even higher on the secondary market. However, it also seems to be talked about less than Elmer T. Lee and Blanton’s which in my personal experience seems to be due to its even more infrequent release than the rest of the Mashbill #2 bourbons. Put simply, it’s just not top of mind.

For its $60, it’s a great value. This is especially true in light of Blanton’s Gold’s $120 price tag. Sure the bourbons have their nuanced differences, but for half the price, you can’t beat the value in comparison. Rock Hill Farms delivers a great pour for the price and is well worth a pick up if you happen across it on shelves.","It may not get as much attention as its Mashbill #2 siblings, but Rock Hill Farms single barrel bourbon delivers in all the right areas and is another solid single barrel in the Buffalo Trace family lineup.","Rock Hill Farms doesn’t come up in conversation as much as it deserves, and part of the reason is that even 6-7 years ago you didn’t see this very often on shelves. Its unassuming bottle with its extra large cork topper and bottle design often gave off the impression of a bourbon that was the odd kid out. It’s a shame too, because when you take the time to really look at the bottle, with its horses that come across as hand painted, it’s actually one of the more tastefully done bottles on the market now.

The fact of the matter is, Rock Hill Farms stands shoulder to shoulder with its Mashbill #2 siblings. It’s not a big bold pour like so many bourbons strive to deliver. Instead it delivers a delicious flavor profile that balances a nice dose of spice with additional rich creamy flavors throughout the sip.

It’s a small batch whiskey consisting of 10-20 barrels that is a blend of 2-5 year old whiskey in new charred oak barrels. Stranahan’s is made from 100% rocky mountain barley & water.

Each bottle is hand-bottled by a rotating crew of volunteers and contains the handwritten date the whiskey was distilled, whom it was distilled by, and a comment from the individual bottling it. The bottle being reviewed was distilled on 6-11-12 by Greg. The individual who bottled it left the comment “Go Rockies!” These one-off comments are a nice touch which makes each bottle of Stranahan’s unique. Additionally, each bottle contains a metal cap that can be used to pour a perfect 3 ounce pour.","The nose on Stranahan’s is different than your typical American whiskey, and for good reason. They’ve basically produced the equivalent of a malted scotch in Colorado. I’m greeted with a blast of sickly sweet scents of vanilla, fresh marshmallows, and apple butter along with oats and, oddly enough, a hint of creamed corn. There is a complete absence of  alcohol burn on the nose.

To me this is a great unique scent profile that you just don’t find when drinking other American whiskeys. I will say that the nose may not appeal to everyone, especially those who are used to drinking bourbon or rye. That being said, I kept going back to smell this throughout the tasting and really enjoyed the uniqueness it brings to the table.","This is a really interesting palate. Oak is very noticeable along with light barley and oats. A little deeper is vanilla, mixed dried fruit, and a touch of honey and dried nuts. It’s certainly an interesting full flavor combination and one you’ll want to linger on. When an individual is starting to really get into whiskey, and a whiskey is described to them as having a really good mouthfeel, it’s sometimes hard to understand what that means. If you’re in this situation, then I really recommend you try a glass of Stranahan’s neat, as this whiskey has a fantastic mouthfeel. Rich and full, the flavors coat your tongue and this whiskey sits heavy in your mouth.","A sharp dose of pepper dominates the initial burn, almost like biting into a peppercorn accidentally. After this spike the heat lingers for a bit. Ironically, the burn is kind of nice once you get past the initial sting, making for a long lasting sweet finish rounded out with elements of burnt brown sugar, caramel, and dark chocolate.","When compared to other American whiskeys, this is one of the more unique ones. There are few other craft distillers out there who are making as big a waves as Stranahan’s has been over the years. While others such as Balcones and Ranger Creek also make 100% barely whiskeys, they also compete in the bourbon and rye space too. With bourbon and rye being on fire these last few years, you have to give Stranahan’s credit for taking a more unique approach to whiskey making and sticking with just 100% barley whiskey as their only product on the market. Sure they have their Diamond Peak and Snowflake releases, but those are just variations on the aging and barreling of their core 100% barley product. The end result could have been disastrous, however it’s pulled off quite nicely here.","The problem with craft distilled products is that distilleries try to command a price that isn’t in line with current well established whiskey products in the market. While in line with other craft distillery pricing, Stranahan’s still commands a price that I feel might be too high for some. True you’re getting a really unique whiskey experience, that you normally don’t get with other craft products, however for $55 you’re competing with some really great bourbons and ryes in the market. I would prefer to see the price come in at $45 to make it more accessible to those looking to add some variety to their collections.

For something this unique I would recommend that people try it at a bar before they buy a bottle. You’ll either really be into something this different, or it won’t be your cup of tea and you’ll have saved yourself $55 plus dollars on a bottle.","Funky, fresh, and so uniquely different it’s worth a shot to seek out and try.","Sure you could call Stranahan’s an American Single Malt and try to compare it to 100% malted barley scotches in the marketplace based on just the ingredients used and the aging ruleset Stranahan’s follows, however I think that would be an unfair comparison. Stranahan’s isn’t trying to emulate scotch makers, instead they’re taking a unique approach to distilling American whiskey in a way that others currently aren’t. I had a chance to speak with current Master Distiller Rob Dietrich at this year’s Chicago WhiskyFest, and I can say the man is passionate about creating fine American whiskey. It’s reassuring to see such fire out of a company that could easily rest on its young, yet well established, laurels.

There’s no doubt that this is a different whiskey product than a bourbon or rye drinker would be used to trying. Its nose and palate are as funky as they come and people are either going to love it or hate it. Personally I’m a big fan and it’s nice to see an American whiskey maker shaking up the market. It’s a funky twist on American whiskey that everyone should try for themselves before making a judgement call on this unique brand.",Jordan,4,4,3,3.5,2.5,3.5,https://www.breakingbourbon.com/review/stranahans-colorado-whiskey
,Sweetens Cove Bourbon,Classification: Straight Bourbon,"Company: Sweetens Cove Spirits, LLC","Distillery: Sourced (from an undisclosed distillery in Tennessee, presumably George Dickel)",Release Date: June 2020,Proof: 101.4 (Cask Strength),Age: 13 Years,"Mashbill: 84% Corn, 8% Rye, 8% Malted Barley",Color: Dark Caramel,Price: $200 (2020),Official Website,"Football player, tennis player, sports announcer, golf course, bourbon. This odd pairing came to be when Peyton Manning, Andy Roddick, Jim Nantz, and others became co-owners of the Tennessee golf course, Sweetens Cove. The course had a tradition of offering a complimentary shot of whiskey on the first hole. The new owners decided to take the tradition to a new level by offering their own blended bourbon to golfers. After purchasing 100 barrels of 13 year old Tennessee bourbon, they hired Marianne Eaves, former Brown-Forman blender and Castle & Key distiller to blend their new bourbon.

With so much bourbon in their possession, the team decided to offer a limited 14,000 bottle release in select markets. According to the company, five batches were created, but bottles won’t feature the batch number, instead requiring the consumer to taste the difference between batches. With this being cask strength bourbon, there is a good chance differentiating proof between batches will signify which batch is which. Out of the 100 barrels, four barrels were deemed “too special” and will be reserved for a special release in 2020. Sweetens Cove Bourbon was released exclusively in Tennessee in May before expanding to more markets starting in June.","Gentle and sweet, the aroma is adorned with caramel, green apple, cream soda, brown sugar, and toasted oak, with coconut and almond drifting in late. It’s a delightful concoction of scents that are allowed to stand on equal ground, and are only held back by their moderate intensity.","Surprisingly thin and watery at first before the flavors kick in and jumpstart your curiosity. A nicely tempered flush of sweet vanilla, chocolate cake, cherry, pecan, and syrupy oak with a dash of pepper follows. It's a delicious medley of well-balanced flavors that in conjunction with its low cask strength proof, produces a rich yet gentle sip that is a joy to drink.","Drying oak turning slightly bitter leads the finish down a dangerous path. Toasted almonds, banana bread, black cherry, and dark chocolate are introduced and take command of its aftertaste, providing a pleasant flare of flavor. It ultimately ends on a dry note that is neither exciting or beneficial, leaning more towards acceptable than outward glee.","There have been many whiskeys that feature well known celebrities as part of their story. Brett Ratner with The Hilhaven Lodge, Metallica with Blackened, Bob Dylan with Heaven’s Door, even outside of whiskey, George Clooney with Casamigos and Ryan Reynolds’ Aviation Gin to name just a few. So it’s up to you if you feel celebrity appeal adds or detracts from the experience you get out of a particular bottle.

Being from Tennessee, 13 years old and considering its mashbill, it is safe to say this was sourced from George Dickel. Its age statement is impressive at first glance until you realize the amount of 13 year old Dickel on the market, which include Dickel’s own Bottled in Bond release, numerous private selection single barrels, and various non-distiller producers (NDP) sourcing it for their own brands. In fact, it's probably oversaturated the market, but that doesn’t mean there can’t be amazing single barrels released of it, well-crafted blends with it, or creative finishes that can be done to it.

Marianne Eaves was called on to blend Sweetens Cove, and is a celebrity in the bourbon community in her own right. She worked extensively under master distiller Chris Morris at Brown-Forman and was directly responsible for Old Forester 1870. It wasn’t long after that release that she left the company and was hired by Castle & Key Distillery. After a few short years, Eaves left that company before they released their first whiskey distillate. Her resume doesn’t include many products that she was solely responsible for, which makes it hard to discern her particular style of blending.

At face value, Sweetens Cove doesn’t offer a drastic improvement from other 13 year old Dickel bourbons, but what it does offer is much more subtle. While plenty sweet, it also features a more interesting and expertly balanced flavor profile compared to many Dickel whiskeys I tasted it against. Its finish is its most disappointing factor and the major anchor pulling down this bourbon from reaching greater heights. Most interestingly, is its low proof for a cask strength bourbon. Dickel isn’t known for this, so it would be interesting to know if low proof barrels were purposely sought out, if Dickel changed their barrel entry proof in the late 2000’s, or if Dickel simply sold off higher proof barrels first and now are left with predominantly lower proof barrels as many recent Dickel barrels have clocked in at a lower proof. The end result though is a bourbon that sips lower than its proof, yet is rich and surprisingly flavorful despite its thin mouthfeel.","Quite frankly $200 is a bold price and somewhat insulting to the Tennessee market where this bourbon is sourced from, and for the first month of release, is exclusively available to. Even at an impressive 13 years old, many brands are sourcing 10+ year old Dickel and offering bottles at a fraction of the price. They often taste very similar to where many might not be able to tell the difference unless they were side-by-side.

Of course the notable names involved create value from a marketing viewpoint, which in turn increases the end cost to consumers. This was never going to be priced the same as another NDP sourcing the same bourbon without all of the names involved, and from a business standpoint it shouldn't be. The average consumer isn’t going to be informed enough to know similar variations of this product can be bought at a fraction of the price. Celebrity names draw attention along with higher prices, and this is why more and more celebrity spirits continually hit the market. Sweetens Cove is aiming wide and casting the biggest net in hopes of catching the biggest fish (or is it whales?). Regardless of the story and who is involved, it ultimately always comes down to what’s in the bottle.

The bourbon’s nose and palate are well crafted and make a good argument to justify its price, but this $200 bourbon will struggle to win over some people with its finish. It comes so close to nailing a great performance yet falters in its final act threatening everything that came before it.","Involving big celebrity names in its conception, Sweetens Cove equally features a big age statement and price, yet this well-crafted bourbon will satisfy most who take a swing at it.","As a bourbon that was designed to be taken as a shot or quick sip at the first hole of Sweetens Cove golf course, I can see it performing admirably in this application. This whiskey has a lot to offer with its sweet yet tempered sip that’s highlighted by an array of well-balanced flavors and deep oak backbone.  

I doubt many who buy this at $200 will feel they didn’t purchase a quality product, because it is exactly that. Despite a less-than-stellar finish, this drinks easy and features a flavor profile many will ultimately enjoy. For others who don’t enjoy Dickel’s flavor profile, I don’t see Sweetens Cove convincing you otherwise. In a vacuum Sweetens Cove will satisfy, although those who spend the time to educate themselves on what else is available on the market will find something very comparable at a fraction of the price.",Eric,3.5,4,2.5,3,2,3.5,https://www.breakingbourbon.com/review/sweetens-cove-bourbon
,Thomas H. Handy 2014 Release,Classification: Rye,Company: Sazerac Company Inc.,Distillery: Buffalo Trace,Released: Fall 2014,Proof: 129.2,"Age: 6 Years, 3 Months",Mashbill: Undisclosed,Color:  Copper,MSRP: $80 (2014),Official Website,"Thomas H. Handy 2014 edition is a barrel proof uncut / unfiltered rye whiskey which was aged a total of 6 years and 3 months at the time of bottling. It came in at 129.2 proof which is slightly more than last year’s, but still in the same ballpark. Buffalo Trace hand-picked 47 barrels which saw a 33.24% loss to evaporation. An estimated total of 8,393 bottles were produced.","The moment I poured this rye into my glass, a strong burst of alcohol scent filled the air around me. This whiskey is not for the faint of heart. So, it was no surprise that a very strong dose of alcohol is upfront and present on the nose. Behind the alcohol are faint traces of citrus and dried raisins.","The 2014 Handy has a very hot flavorful palate. The heat starts the moment the whiskey hits your mouth. At first, a touch of sweet vanilla is present, which instantly transforms into leather, wood, allspice and rye spice.","The finish on this bourbon reminds you of what you’re drinking right to the end - a big, bold barrel proof rye. Hot and full of pepper, this finish lingers with you for a long time. The heat starts on the tip of your tongue and slowly envelops your whole mouth before inching its way down your throat. This by no means is a bad thing, as it’s less of a jet fuel burning sensation (e.g. Stagg Jr) and more of a spicy hot finish that makes you appreciate the uniqueness of what you’re drinking. Sitting 2-3 minutes between sips, you’re treated to subtle lingering notes of dried raisin and hay. The mixture is quite delicious and makes you want to go back for another sip just to experience the very tail end of the finish again.","In the microcosm of the BTAC collection, Thomas Handy isn’t the most unique bottle per production numbers. It's actually the second highest produced after George T. Stagg. Compared to other annual whiskeys, I’d consider this a smaller release, as Buffalo Trace still only bottled and released less than 8,500 bottles of Handy this year, making it unique from that standpoint. It may be a young rye, but it delivers a big distinct flavor profile that other whiskeys are hard-pressed to replicate.

Furthermore, few companies are actively distilling and releasing their own barrel proof aged ryes. Sure you could find aged Willetts as old as or older than the Handy line, but, none deliver the year-over-year consistency that you’re able to find with this whiskey.","In a world full of ever-rising whiskey costs, Buffalo Trace continues to offer their Antique Collection at a reasonable price. While the $80 MSRP is $10 more than last year, you’re getting access to the best honey barrels available at the distillery, bottled at barrel proof, and unfiltered. You’re not going to get a better opportunity to taste what the Master Distiller is tasting than with this release of Thomas Handy. A very solid value indeed for a barrel proof uncut / unfiltered rye.","Even if it’s the youngest and second most common bottle in the BTAC lineup, it still delivers a special unique treat for those who are able to try it.","It's a shame that Thomas Handy often gets overlooked in the BTAC collection due to being more widely produced and younger compared to the other whiskeys in the lineup. Once again Handy is a quality rye that delivers a great experience to whiskey drinkers. While I don’t find it to be the standout of this year’s lineup or as spectacular as years past, it still continues to be a very enjoyable pour. Handy truly is a versatile whiskey that I’d recommend to warm you up on a cold winter’s day or to cool you down on a sweltering New Orleans summer night. If you see a bottle, don’t hesitate to buy it, and definitely share it with your friends when you do.",Jordan,2.5,3,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,https://www.breakingbourbon.com/review/thomas-h-handy-2014-release
,Trail’s End Bourbon Batch 003,Classification: Straight Bourbon (finished with Oregon Oak Staves),Company: Hood River Distillers,Distillery: Undisclosed distillery in Kentucky,Released: 2018,Proof: 90,Age: 8 Years,"Mashbill: Undisclosed (Corn, malted barley, and ~10% rye)",Color:  Medium Amber,MSRP: $40 (2018),Official Website,"Trail’s End bourbon is Kentucky Straight Bourbon that has been transported to Oregon and finished with medium toasted Oregon Oak staves. While the mashbill is undisclosed, it has been confirmed to be a traditional bourbon mashbill consisting of corn, malted barley, and roughly 10% rye. Being a straight bourbon originating from a single distillery in Kentucky with 10% rye in the mashbill, the most likely source is Heaven Hill. Batches will be released on an ongoing basis, and while they may vary slightly from batch to batch, the intent is to create a uniform flavor profile across batches. This particular bottle is from Batch 003.

Trail’s End works in partnership with the National Forest Foundation, a partnership that began in 2017 and will run through 2019. For every bottle sold, a portion of the revenue is donated to the Trees for Us program with the Foundation. To date, the partnership has assisted in planting over 5,000 trees.","Light and inviting. Raisins, honey, and a trace of fresh wood characterize the aroma. Its 90 proof is evident here, as the scents are relaxed and mild, making for a pleasant, albeit subtle, experience.","A burst of flavor that’s immensely enjoyable yet not overpowering. Vanilla bean, maple syrup, cotton candy, apple, and a touch of anise make up the sweeter notes. Nutmeg and fresh oak balance them out, bringing a touch of spice and trace of wood into the mix. The mouthfeel is satisfying, and well above average considering the proof.","Light spice pops at first, followed by traces of the sweeter elements on the palate. The sweet turns to dry, giving way to a subtle yet lengthy finish. Overall the sip is delicate and notably well balanced.","In 2016 I included Rebel Yell Single Barrel in my favorite whiskeys of the year. A 100 proof 10 year old sourced wheated bourbon originating from Kentucky, it was most likely distilled by Heaven Hill. At $50 (for the first release), it wowed me with its overall quality at an (almost) everyman’s price.

Trail’s End Batch 003 is very reminiscent of Rebel Yell Single Barrel. It echoes the same level of craftsmanship, and side by side it’s even more apparent they’re within the same range of quality and drinkability. As opposed to bombastic flavor or a funky finish, Trail’s End instead offers balance - a quality many strive for, but few are able to achieve.

The company attributes this balance to the medium toasted Oregon Oak stave finishing - a process much like Maker’s Mark uses to createMaker’s 46. This finishing is said to soften the wood notes allowing other flavors to shine through. While the exact length of time the staves are used for finishing varies, the company states that batch consistency and achieving the desired flavor profile are the driving factors in determining how long the bourbon is finished. Regardless of how the bourbon begins, finishing with barrel staves is something few are doing, and the end result is certainly a good one.","The technicals place Trail’s End in a bit of a pinch when it comes to pricing. At 8 years old and 90 proof it will be approached with a price expectation. Being sourced from Kentucky helps with perception (there seem to be far fewer whiskeys sourced from Kentucky distilleries than Indiana distilleries nowadays), as does its high end packaging. The additional Oregon Oak stave finishing adds an element of value that cannot be ignored, a step that takes time and money to accomplish. But in the end, it’s the flavor profile that will win fans over. As a result, $40 feels like a really good deal in today’s frenzied marketplace.","An immensely enjoyable bourbon that won’t wow with a high proof or pomp and circumstance, but will impress with overall balance and drinkability.","Some bourbons that I end up enjoying take a little getting to know before I appreciate them, while others I like on first sip. Trail’s End Batch 003 is one of those first sip bourbons. It didn’t wow me with an explosion of new or unusual flavors, but it immediately struck me as something I could drink every day. When it comes to sourced whiskey, some brands do it better than others, and few add something extra. This one does just that, and it’s one you’ll want to take note of.

,Weller Antique 107 (2019),Classification: Straight Bourbon,"Company: Sazerac Company, Inc.",Distillery: Buffalo Trace,Release Date: Ongoing,Proof: 107,Age: NAS,"Mashbill: Undisclosed (Buffalo Trace “Wheated” Mashbill - Corn, Wheat, Malted Barley)",Color: Dark Copper,Price: $50 (2019),Official Website,"W.L. Weller is a wheated bourbon originally created by the Stitzel-Weller Distilling Company. The brand is named after William Larue Weller, a distiller who is credited by some as being the first to use wheat as the secondary grain in straight bourbon as opposed to the more commonly used rye.

Notably, William Larue Weller hired the famous Julian Van Winkle, who would later be known as “Pappy.” Van Winkle began his career working for Weller. Weller passed in 1899, and coincidentally his company, W.L. Weller & Sons, later merged with the A. Ph. Stitzel Distillery which was owned by his former employee, Julian “Pappy” Van Winkle. The companies worked together through Prohibition operating under a medicinal license, and eventually became the Stitzel-Weller Distilling Company in 1935.

Weller Antique 107, sometimes just referred to as Old Weller Antique, Antique 107, or even simply abbreviated as OWA, is one of the three bottles that were, at one time, released on an ongoing basis and commonly seen on liquor store shelves - this also included W.L. Weller Special Reserve and W.L. Weller 12 Year. They were joined by the less common William Larue Weller, which is part of the Buffalo Trace Antique Collection and released annually each year. In December 2016 the three ongoing releases underwent a label redesign. The lineup expanded in 2018 with the addition of W.L. Weller C.Y.P.B. (short for Craft Your Perfect Bourbon), and then again in 2019 with the addition of W.L. Weller Full Proof. A label for W.L. Weller Single Barrel was recently approved by the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau (TTB).

The bottle in review was purchased in 2019.","Aromas of lush dark fruit burst forth from the glass and combine with vanilla and caramel. There’s a healthy dose of seasoned oak which provides dimension. Finally, it’s punctuated with a pop of cinnamon bark spice and traces of black licorice. It’s balanced, complex, and well-developed.","The first thing I notice is how full-bodied and oily the bourbon feels rolling around in my mouth. Cinnamon spice grips the taste buds, followed by cherries, dark fruits, raw sugar, and aged oak. The proof is quite manageable, and arguably a bit understated as the flavors really take charge versus any sign of heat. This combination of a rich, heavy mouthfeel and cinnamon against dark fruit and oak is as pleasing as it is delicious.","A crescendo of cinnamon spice introduces the finish. Sweeter notes of caramel and vanilla follow. A flavor akin to tobacco hints in the background though it's subtle and hard to pinpoint. An undercurrent of cinnamon remains throughout, and then lingers. Quite pleasant.","The list of bourbons with wheat as the secondary grain is still much less than rye, however it is growing. In addition to the Weller line, the most notable are Maker’s Mark and Larceny, two widespread ongoing releases from large Kentucky distilleries much like Antique. Higher proof versions of each are also available, with Maker’s having released Maker’s Mark Cask Strength and Larceny Barrel Proof coming to market. Weller Antique 107 is believed to be in the 6-8 year range, which is also the same range as Maker’s and Larceny. With that being said, Weller is arguably the more balanced sip of the bunch. Its 107 proof allows for a nice interplay between robust flavors and drinkability quite well.

Notably, the Weller lineup is distilled using what is believed to be the same mashbill as the Old Rip Van Winkle bourbon lineup, commonly referred to as “Pappy.” Buffalo Trace began distilling the Old Rip Van Winkle lineup as a joint venture in 2002. Their youngest bourbon in the lineup, Old Rip Van Winkle 10 Year, clocks in at the same 107 proof as Weller Antique 107. Given the fact that Antique does not have an age statement, it’s not unrealistic to assume the two might be similar in makeup, even if Antique is a bit younger overall. Moreover, bourbon geeks are all too familiar with a phrase called “Poor Man’s Pappy,” which involves mixing Weller Antique 107, W.L. Weller Special Reserve, and even W.L. Weller 12 Year at varying percentages in an effort to mimic the proofs, and ideally flavor profiles, of certain bottles in the Van Winkle lineup.

This combination of distiller, mashbill, and in some cases age and proof, has helped the Weller bourbons gain quite a bit of favor as compared to other wheated bourbon rivals, placing them very close to the highly revered Van Winkle lineup. Weller Antique 107 is of course included in this mix, and while it is a great bourbon, I would argue it’s in the same wheelhouse as Maker’s Mark Cask Strength and Larceny Barrel Proof.  ","At one time the ongoing release Weller bourbons, typically found for $20-$30 depending on which bottle and the particular store, were exemplary of high value available bourbons. They made our Best of Bourbon lists in their respective price range each year, and few would argue they weren’t top of their class in that price range.

Not surprisingly, the market has caught up. While the MSRP stayed in the $30 range for quite some time, retailers often charged quite a bit more for any bottle with the Weller name on it, and consumers were often willing to pay it. While Weller Antique 107 distribution is widespread, demand now outstrips supply causing bottles to be held back and not put on shelves along with fairly steep markup over the MSRP. So while Antique 107 may have had a suggested retail price of around $30, finding it at that price became a whole different animal. Due to this scarcity, we removed all Weller bottles from our Best of lists.

Since our initial review, the MSRP for Weller Antique 107 was officially raised to $50. Taking it at face value and at the stated MSRP, Weller Antique 107 is a fair value. Its 107 proof hits the spot, and even within the ever-expanding Weller lineup it wouldn’t be surprising if someone crowned it their favorite. It does, however, remain to be seen whether this price increase will reduce some of the demand in the coming years.","Weller Antique 107 is a crowd pleaser - full-flavored, balanced, and a fair deal if you happen to get lucky and find it at its new MSRP.","Eric reviewed Old Weller Antique 107 nearly six years ago and called it “A full spicy flavor at a nice proof and price.” While I still agree with that comment today, the market has caught up and is much different than it was when he reviewed it. Finding a Weller Antique 107, let alone at or near its MSRP, has become quite difficult. While this unprecedented demand is due in part to the quality of the bourbon, the fact that Buffalo Trace also distills the Old Rip Van Winkle lineup (or “Pappy” as it’s commonly referred to) using what is believed that the same wheated mashbill that’s used for the Weller bourbons, has certainly contributed to the insanity. Not surprisingly, the MSRP for Weller Antique 107 has officially risen to $50.

With all the hype around Weller Antique 107, it’s all too easy to write it off entirely as overblown enthusiasm. In fact, this is the first new design Weller bottle I’ve opened, and more specifically the first Weller Antique 107 bottle I’ve opened in quite a few years simply because it’s been so hard to find I went quite a while without buying any. I had forgotten how much I enjoy it. But at the same time I don’t feel as if it’s nearly as mind-blowing as some may have you believe, instead it’s a bourbon whose asking price is now commensurate with its value.

Editor’s Note: When this review was originally published, the MSRP was stated at its previous amount. The review was updated on 12/19/2019, along with applicable ratings, to reflect the now current MSRP of $50.",Nick,3.5,4,3.5,3,2.5,3.5,https://www.breakingbourbon.com/review/weller-antique-107

The process allows people to choose a bourbon recipe, placement in the warehouse for aging, number of years to age the bourbon, and final proof for bottling. According to Buffalo Trace, after a little over two years over 100,000 bourbon fans completed this process of crafting their own bourbon.

The majority of respondents chose a wheated bourbon recipe, aged for eight years on the top floor of the rickhouse, and then bottled somewhere between 90-99 proof. Based on this response, Buffalo Trace decided to create C.Y.P.B. under their existing Weller line which consists exclusively of wheated bourbons. The first batch was released in summer of 2018, with additional batches expected annually thereafter.

The bottle in review is from the 2019 release.","Sweet caramel and floral aromas are most prominent, with a dash of seasoned oak underneath. A swirl of the glass reveals a touch of butterscotch. The nose is lively and bright with little trace of ethanol, making for an inviting introduction to the sip.","Noticeably sweet up front, the initial burst of flavors is comprised of peaches, butterscotch, vanilla, caramel, and a hint of citrus. A moderate amount of aged oak rounds out the backend, providing just enough intensity to hint towards the bourbon’s age. The flavors are nicely balanced, making for a well-developed and very pleasant sip.","Delivering a general warming sensation at first, the finish transitions to a tapering spice as it progresses. Light seasoned oak comes into play, along with a hint of citrus. Long and quite enjoyable overall, providing more intensity of flavor than you typically get at this proofpoint. An appropriate endcap to a nicely balanced bourbon.","W.L. Weller C.Y.P.B. joins a growing list of wheated bourbons. In recent years we have seen the W.L. Weller line expand from W.L. Weller Special Reserve, Weller Antique 107, W.L. Weller 12 Year, and the limited edition William Larue Weller (also part of the annual Buffalo Trace Antique Collection), adding W.L. Weller C.Y.P.B. in 2018, W.L. Weller Full Proof in 2019, and more recently a label approval for a potential W.L. Weller Single Barrel release.

I tried it years ago, and before writing this review gave it another try. I was surprised that as I progressed through the choices, three of the four lined up with the majority - a wheated mashbill (this appears to be pretty non-specific with respect to percentages), age on the top floor of the rickhouse, for eight years, and then unlike the majority I chose a higher final bottling proof. Looking back at some of the descriptors associated with the choices, I can see how some might be more appealing than others leading many down a similar path, though I think this was in the light of explanation and not necessarily intentional.

Regardless, the idea that some of the factors contributing to Weller C.Y.P.B.’s creation were based on the results of the interactive experience makes it a more interesting interplay between distillery and consumers than you typically see. Additionally, from a flavor profile perspective what makes C.Y.P.B. stand out is its balance. It comes across as more carefully constructed than the rest of the Weller lineup, and certainly more balanced than big wheated rivals like Larceny and Maker’s Mark.","C.Y.P.B. is a limited edition release, and Buffalo Trace has indicated they will only release one batch per year. To date, only two batches have been released. The interactive experience adds some value here, however the tie-in is looser than it could be with additional long term development that might include some more specific choices and greater variation of the end product from existing bourbons. It’s also a wheated bourbon, which is the less popular of the secondary grains compared to rye, however as more and more wheated bourbons come to market this trait has become less notable. All of this is presented with what I would describe as the more balanced of the Weller lineup, but not necessarily the most exciting. To that end, the asking price is more than fair.

While we assess value ratings and typically focus value discussions around MSRP, the fact that the pricing for C.Y.P.B. has gotten so out of control so quickly - even at the retailer level - is worth addressing, as some are paying upwards of $700 or more for a bottle. This price, by measure of the bourbon inside, is nothing short of pure insanity. While other factors noted above will contribute to this demand, C.Y.P.B. is at best, an above-average bourbon with a nicely developed flavor profile that will please many. So unless spending a large sum of money on a bottle is of little consequence to your bottom line, I would certainly stay within the range of MSRP on this one...that is if you’re one of the lucky few who is offered the opportunity.","W.L. Weller C.Y.P.B. was created by crowdsourcing, bringing with it an interesting story of how it came to be resulting in a carefully crafted, well-balanced but not overly exciting end result.","In tasting C.Y.P.B. I made it a point to compare it to other bottles in the Weller lineup that I had - Special Reserve, Antique 107, and 12 Year. In doing so, it revealed something I had not realized prior, which was the higher degree of balance found in C.Y.P.B. - sweet notes, oak intensity, and so on - was at least a notch above the rest. Despite this, I still find Antique 107 to be my personal favorite, followed by 12 Year, C.Y.P.B., and finally Special Reserve in a distant last place. Given the demand for these products, it is important to realize that C.Y.P.B., like the rest of the Weller lineup, is a quality bourbon but still not worth losing your mind over. This holds especially true as we have seen demand for Weller bourbons skyrocket in recent years.

I really enjoy Buffalo Trace’s Craft Your Perfect Bourbon interactive experience, and I encourage you to take a pit stop there next if you have not done so yet. Further, I hope to see more of this type of interactive bourbon-making from Buffalo Trace and others in the future. Kudos to Buffalo Trace for getting so many people interested in this level of interaction...now let’s see more of it.",Nick,3.5,3.5,3.5,3,3,3.5,https://www.breakingbourbon.com/review/w-l-weller-c-y-p-b-2019
,1792 Port Finish,Classification: Straight Bourbon Finished In Port Barrels,Company: Sazerac Company Inc.,Distillery: Barton 1792 Distillery,Released: October 2015,Proof: 88.9,Age: NAS,Mashbill: Undisclosed,Color:  Light Ruby,MSRP: $40 (2016),Official Website,"Per the back of the label: ""This bourbon was aged for many years in new white oak barrels before spending another two years extracting the subtle, yet sweet flavors from port wine barrels."" Per the press release: ""Aged for six years in new American white oak barrels before spending another two years maturing inside used port wine barrels.

Although this is the first and only batch of 1792 Port Finish Bourbon, the distillery is considering making more. This is Barton’s second release in a series of new expressions of 1792 following the release of the 1792 Sweet Wheat Bourbon.","Less floral than I was expecting from a bourbon that was finished for two years in used port barrels. After immediately pouring a glass, I’m treated to hints of light apple, nuts, and charred oak. However, after letting it open up for 10 minutes, the scent profile changes to something quite different. The nuttiness, while slightly noticeable, mellows out and is instead dominated by notes of cinnamon, baking spices, spiced apples, and a faint hint of fresh wood. The nose is pleasant, though I would not guess that this was aged for two years in port barrels based on the scents alone.","While the nose may lull you into believing that this bourbon wasn’t finished in port barrels for two years, the palate smacks you right back to reality. The time spent in the port barrels is immediately noticeable as it allowed the bourbon to pick up additional flavors from the wood. A nice viscous mouthfeel is present along with flavors of fruit punch, apples, sugar, and a hint of preserved strawberries; reminiscent of a subtle bourbon sangria. It’s sweet without being overpowering, however you still realize that you're drinking a bourbon at all times. Really subtle and enjoyable, and a great change of pace from other recent wine barrel finished bourbons.","The nuttiness initially found in the nose reappears in the finish, however not as assertive as before. Instead, it starts more subtle and is mixed together with notes of new oak, caramel, and the preserved strawberries. The finish lingers for some time, with the nuttiness flavor being the main dominant note that carries through."," The uniqueness factor on this bourbon needs to be looked at from two fronts. From the barrel finishing standpoint, the uniqueness is off the chart. No other mass produced bourbon has spent two years finished in wine barrels; usually it’s for a much shorter amount of time. It’s really interesting to see what happens after allowing the bourbon to age two additional years in the port barrels after spending six years in new charred oak barrels to start. From a flavor perspective, it’s a nice enhancement over the regular 1792. The general nuttiness and base characteristics I find in the standard 1792 still carry over, while the influence of the port barrels is evident without being too overpowering.","At $40 a bottle, this is a great deal for a barrel finished bourbon, especially one that has spent so much additional time in the barrel finishing stage. The closest barrel finished bourbon in price is Michter's Toasted Oak priced at $50. However, these are two very different finished bourbons to compare in terms of barrels used for the finish, time spent in the finishing phase, and flavor profile. Other companies have done wine barrel finishes including High West A Midwinter Nights Dram and Woodford Reserve 2014 Master’s Collection, however at around $100 each, both bottles retail for two and a half times the price of 1792 Port Finish.",Kudos to Barton 1792 Distillery for bringing a well-balanced barrel finished bourbon to the masses at a very affordable price.,"For those who haven’t dived into barrel finished bourbons, this is a really good place to start. While the key highlight is clearly the palate which is sandwiched between just an average nose and finish, it still has an overall enjoyable flavor profile that is bourbon forward. It’s a nice way to experience the subtle nuances that barrel finishing imparts on a bourbon without having to taste something that is radically different from your standard whiskey profile.

Additionally, at $40, you really don’t have much to lose. After experiencing a barrel finish of this length, at this low of a cost, I hope other distillers follow suit and offer barrel finished bourbons at a similar low price point.",Jordan,2.5,4,2.5,3,4,3,https://www.breakingbourbon.com/review/1792-port-finish
In Depth Review,1792 Sweet Wheat,Straight Bourbon,Sazerac Company Inc.,Barton 1792 Distillery,July 2015,91.2,NAS (Press release states 8 years),Undisclosed,Rust,$35 (2016),,"This is the first time Barton has released a wheated 1792 Bourbon. A bourbon’s secondary grain is usually rye, but a small percentage of bourbon producers use wheat instead. The standard 1792 expression is considered “high rye” since it is thought to use more rye as its secondary grain than in traditional bourbon mashbills. This is the first in the series of new expressions of 1792. A port finished bourbon is also due in October 2015. It is rumored that a single barrel, barrel strength, and rye are also planned.

","A very nice blend of young and old wood notes, with lighter punches of black cherry, vanilla, orange, and a slight hint of spice. It’s not an overpowering blend for a 91 proof bourbon, but it certainly has a good amount of life to it. Not overly complex, but its surface level aromas are hard to dislike.","A well balanced blend of sweet and dry notes that airs on the simple side. The usual bourbon flavors are present with vanilla and caramel being most prevalent. Fainter hints of dried fruit, pine, and walnuts are also noticeable, but have a hard time fully emerging. The bourbon’s soft and creamy mouthfeel is easily its most interesting trait, which helps make this one of the easiest drinkers that I’ve had in some time. While enjoyable, the palate is not immediately memorable.","The creamy mouthfeel thins on the finish and leaves a mildly dry aftertaste. The sweet caramel notes fade giving way to a leathery, oaky, relatively short finish. It’s an average finish at best that lacks much character.","This one is a little deceiving. Drinking it on its own, fresh out of the bottle, I wasn’t blown away. It immediately comes off as an average bourbon. After giving it a few weeks to “breathe” in the bottle - while it didn’t drastically increase its overall quality - I felt like I enjoyed it much more than my first go around with it. I then tasted it against similarly priced wheaters: Maker’s Mark, Weller 12 Year, and Weller Special Reserve. While I’d be hard pressed to say it is in the same ballpark as Weller 12 Year, I did enjoy it more than the other two wheaters I compared it against. This was mainly based on 1792 Sweet Wheat’s agreeable nose/palate and its very soft and creamy mouthfeel. In fact, it’s this creamy mouthfeel that ultimately is the bourbon’s most standout trait. It takes its otherwise average(ish) palate and delivers it in a more memorable way. There aren’t many bourbons in this price range that have the same seductive mouthfeel as this does.

","Being priced at $33 gives the impression that it’s one of the more expensive “everyday” wheated bourbons. The thing is, $30 is becoming the new norm for these everyday wheated bourbons. Maker's Mark pricing can be sporadic throughout the country, but the average price is around $30. Weller bourbons - if you can find them - usually start at $30 now. Bernheim hovers around the $30 mark. Larceny is found sub $30, but I personally don’t think it matches the quality of 1792 Sweet Wheat. Having the choice at an almost level playing field in the value department, 1792 Sweet Wheat might be my new go-to wheater (of course if we’re excluding Weller 12 Year).","Easy to drink, reasonably priced for its quality, and has a creamy mouthfeel that will ultimately become its most memorable trait.","1792 Sweet Wheat is a gentle, easy-to-drink wheated bourbon. Its palate is pleasing with its traditional bourbon flavors and semi-sweet notes. It also has a good amount of oak on its palate. This actually might be a determent for some expecting a sweet-forward profile based on the bourbon's name, with the oak notes probably countering what might have been a far sweeter bourbon. Some tannic notes also find their way into the mix, and while they don’t taint the experience much, I would have liked less of them. 1792 Sweet Wheat doesn’t far exceed the quality found in other similar priced wheated bourbon, but it does what it does well, and is priced reasonably for what it is.",Eric,3.5,3,2.5,3,2.5,3,https://www.breakingbourbon.com/review/1792-sweet-wheat
,Baker's Bourbon 7 Year,Classification: Straight Bourbon,Company: Beam Suntory,Distillery: Jim Beam,Released: Ongoing,Proof: 107,Age: 7 Years,"Mashbill: 77% Corn, 13% Rye, 10% Malted Barley",Color:  Dark Copper,MSRP: $55 (2018),Official Website,"Baker’s Bourbon is one of four bourbons that comprise Jim Beam’s Small Batch Bourbon Collection. The others in the series are Basil Hayden’s, Knob Creek, and Booker’s Bourbon. Baker’s falls third in line proof-wise, with Basil Hayden’s and Knob Creek carrying lower proofs and Booker’s being proofed the highest of the four.

Baker’s Bourbon is named after Baker Beam, grandnephew of the legendary Jim Beam.","Heavy baking spices, cinnamon bark, and oak up front. While 107 proof isn’t exactly low, the ethanol on the nose is very forward and in your face. It doesn’t impart a negative experience, however it does make the nose deceive you into thinking it could almost be a barrel proof bourbon. Lingering behind the ethanol is a light trace of vanilla.","Baking spices lead the sip. They’re joined with aged oak, leather, a hint of vanilla, and a healthy hit of brown sugar sweetness. It’s hot, but thankfully drinks more mellow than the nose leads you to believe. A sweet and flavorful sip overall.","The sweetness from the palate carriers over to start the finish. Drier oak, leather, and vanilla merge with a long lingering heat. The heat and dry oak remain while dropping off the sweeter parts. The heat grips your mouth and doesn’t let go, bringing you back to believing this is higher proof than the listed 107. It’s a bold way finish the sip.","Baker’s is an interesting conundrum. Where Basil Hayden’s and Knob Creek have lost their age statements, Baker’s continues to hold onto its seven years. After tasting the bourbon, I believe this is partially out of necessity in today’s marketplace. While it delivers a nice overall sip, there’s just nothing inherently special about it when comparing it individually to Knob Creek or Booker’s. When compared to the entire lineup in general, Baker’s ends up containing some of the sweetness and heat seen in Booker’s along with the bold flavor profile seen in Knob Creek.

Basil Hayden’s is an entryway bourbon for many partly due to its lower 80 proof and appealing bottle design. Knob Creek delivers a bold pour in its standard 100 proof bottling and cranks up the proof for its 120 proof single barrel variant. Booker’s rounds things out with its 120+ proof offerings. This leaves Baker’s trying to slot in proof-wise between the standard bottling of Knob Creek and the Single Barrel offering. This all brings me back to its age statement. Without it, one really would just scratch their head and ask why they don’t skip this line all together or just bottle another variant of Knob to cover this range. Until that time  happens (if ever) the seven years age statement does help differentiate it among its peers.","Until recently Baker’s was an overall poor value in the Small Batch Collection. Knob was readily available for $40 and you could get a bottle of Booker’s for a few dollars more. However now that Booker’s has been steadily increasing towards a $100 price point, and Knob no longer contains an age statement, the price becomes a little more justifiable when comparing it amongst its Small Batch Collection brethren.

That said, the market isn’t comprised of just Small Batch Collection bottles. With the recent introduction of Old Ezra 7 Year Barrel Strength being released for $40, things just got a lot more interesting for Baker’s. Yes Old Ezra delivers a different type of sip, but it can’t be overlooked that it’s also has a 7 year age statement, comes in ten proof points higher at 117, and sells for $15 less. It becomes a lot harder to justify Baker’s all of a sudden. If someone wants a bold flavorful sip with a similar, yet also slightly different flavor profile, you have Knob Creek. If one wants an age stated bourbon that’s high proofed, you have Old Ezra 7 Year Barrel Strength. Both come in cheaper than Baker’s and deliver satisfactory drinking experiences.",A well balanced sip in a bottle that finds itself at a crossroads in today's marketplace.,"Baker’s delivers an above average sip, yet one that seems like the odd man out in the Small Batch Collection. If you’re a fan of the other bottles in the collection, it’s worth seeking out a bottle. If, however, you haven’t had any of the Small Batch Collection yet, you may want to seek out a bottle of one of the other three depending on your proof tolerance. In a world of disappearing age statements, Baker’s 7 year statement may help it stand out, however I’m not sure too many people would notice if it went away. Ironically, the same might be said for Baker’s Bourbon itself as it is so easily overshadowed by its more well known siblings.",Jordan,2.5,3,3,2.5,2,3,https://www.breakingbourbon.com/review/bakers-bourbon-7-year
,Baker’s Bourbon 7 Year Single Barrel,Classification: Straight Bourbon,Company: Beam Suntory,Distillery: Jim Beam,Release Date: Ongoing,Proof: 107,"Age: 8 Years, 6 Months (7 years is minimum for the brand, exact age is also stated on the bottle)","Mashbill: 77% Corn, 13% Rye, 10% Malted Barley",Color: Mahogany,MSRP: $60 (2020),Official Website,"Baker’s Bourbon is one of four bourbons that comprise Jim Beam’s Small Batch Bourbon Collection. The others in the series are Basil Hayden’s, Knob Creek, and Booker’s Bourbon. Baker’s falls third in line proof-wise, with Basil Hayden’s and Knob Creek carrying lower proofs and Booker’s being proofed the highest of the four. Baker’s Bourbon is named after Baker Beam, grandnephew of the legendary Jim Beam.

In the past, Baker’s was a small batch bourbon of around 200 barrels blended together before becoming a single barrel product in 2019. Additionally, the bottle states that it is aged a minimum of 7 years with many single barrels chosen for this bottling appearing to be much older in age. The bottle being reviewed was barrelled in January 2011, comes from warehouse CL-D, and has a serial number of 000185706.","This bourbon instantly identifies as a Beam product, as a nutty aroma jumps out, which is really potent and initially blocks out other scents. Giving a deep inhale however, brings out baking spices along with hints of caramel and vanilla. It would be nice if the nuttiness was not so dominating, however it still presents as a fine way to open the sip.","A plethora of flavors opens up the palate, starting with slightly burnt caramel and spiced vanilla, which mix with green peppercorn and rye spice. Exploring more reveals a trace of sweet syrup which adds a hint of sweetness. While the nose may hide the proof, the boldness of the sip is revealed here and helps to pull forward and exemplify all of the flavors.","The nuttiness found in the nose develops again on the finish and is joined with oak and vanilla. The vanilla quickly dissipates leaving a warming dry oak and nut flavor that dance around each other. These are propped up by a base of heat that reminds you of the 107 proof the bourbon is bottled at. Overall, the medium length finish is a nice way to end the sip.","Baker’s Bourbon 7 Year Single Barrel is the next evolution of the Baker’s brand. Since the brand was first introduced, it was always marked as a batched product, consisting of around 200 barrels or less before bottling. This allowed the brand to produce a consistent flavor profile. While it wasn’t the most popular of the Small Batch Collection, it was an above-average consistent pour and helped fill a proof range that no other bottle in the Small Batch Collection did.

At the end of 2019 that all changed, as Baker’s was no longer a small batch product. Instead, it was split into two new products, the ongoing 7 Year Single Barrel and the more limited 13 Year Single Barrel. While the more limited 13 Year variant sticks to its age statement more closely, the 7 Year Single Barrel often features many barrels actually being 8 years or older.

In the past, I’ve always found Baker’s to be the odd man out in the Small Batch Collection. Thinking of others in the collection, Basil Hayden’s is a gateway bourbon for many partly due to its lower 80 proof and appealing bottle design. Knob Creek Small Batch delivers a bold pour in its standard 100 proof bottling and cranks up the proof for its 120 proof single barrel variant. Booker’s rounds things out with its 120+ proof offerings. This used to leave Baker’s trying to slot in proof-wise between Knob Creek Small Batch and Knob Creek Single Barrel.

Compared to the prior small batch version, designating Baker’s as a single barrel and also introducing an older 13 year version too, helps the brand stand out more in the Small Batch Collection. Consumers now have the chance to try a single barrel that doesn’t ring in at a high proof of 120. Sure Baker’s 7 Year Single Barrel’s 107 proof is no slouch, but the difference between a 107 proof bourbon and a 120 proof bourbon is a lot for many consumers. Additionally, by becoming a single barrel, Baker’s 7 Year is now more differentiated from Knob Creek Small Batch. It was the right move for Beam to do and helps give more purpose to the brand inside of the Small Batch Collection.","It’s interesting that Beam decided to go the single barrel route for it’s younger version of Baker’s. The Small Batch Collection already has the standard Knob Creek Single Barrel which offers a great pour often at a price tag that’s about $10 less than the MSRP of Baker’s 7 Year Single Barrel. Oh and it’s 120 proof. Additionally, with the re-introduction of the 9 year age statement to the standard Knob Creek Small Batch, consumers can pick up a 100 proof 9 year old bottle with the same exact mashbill.

While I found the discontinued small batch Baker’s Bourbon to be a below-average value, the new bottling changes the paradigm slightly. Coming in at only $5-$10 more, the consumer is now getting a single barrel product that is a minimum of 7 years and over 100 proof bottled in a more premium design. While its own sibling Knob Creek 9 Year delivers an overall much better value, not everyone wants or needs a 120 proof single barrel age stated bourbon. This is where the value of Baker’s Single Barrel 7 Year resides.","Baker’s new single barrel status helps give it new purpose in the Small Batch Collection, providing a flavor profile that is uniquely Beam.","The evolution of the Baker’s brand has been an interesting one. While the more limited 13 Year Single Barrel release was able to stand out due to its age, the 7 Year Single Barrel is targeted at a really niche set of consumers. My theory is that Beam was hoping that the new bottle design would help it stand out on shelves and that its continuation of 107 proof attracts those who want to explore 100+ proof single barrel bourbons but are scared off by anything labeled a 110 proof or higher.

The new Baker’s 7 Year Single Barrel may come with a slightly higher price tag, but it still ends up delivering a pleasing above-average sip that is hard to find fault in. Additionally, it helps fill a niche gap in the market of 7 year single barrels in its proof range. It will be interesting to see if the age of this bourbon eventually starts settling closer to that 7 year minimum stated on the bottle, but in the meantime, it’s fun to try Baker’s bottled at an age that no other brand in the Small Batch Collection currently targets. If you’re a fan of other bottles in the Small Batch Collection, it’ll be a bottle worth seeking out and trying once.",Jordan,2.5,3.5,3,3,2.5,3,https://www.breakingbourbon.com/review/bakers-bourbon-7-year-single-barrel
,Balcones “1” Texas Single Malt Whiskey,Classification: Straight Malt Whiskey,Company: Balcones Distilling,Distillery: Balcones Distilling,Release Date: Ongoing,Proof: 106,Age: 2 Years,Mashbill: 100% Malted Barley,Color: Dark Mahogany,MSRP: $70 (2020),Official Website,"The name Balcones originates from the Balcones Fault, a fault that runs from South Texas almost up to the distillery’s home in Waco, Texas. The distillery was founded by Chip Tate in 2008, and began distilling in 2009. Balcones garnered quite a bit of attention from whiskey aficionados as they were doing things differently, which included using stills Tate designed and built on his own. Unfortunately, after a controversial falling out, Tate and Balcones parted ways in 2014.

Originally released as a limited edition in July, 2011, Balcones “1” Texas Single Malt is the company’s flagship spirit. Balcones “1” is made with 100% malt grain, distilled in copper pot stills, aged in new American oak, and non-chill filtered. The bottle being reviewed is from batch SM20-1 and dated 3/6/2020.","Potent in its delivery, a malty aroma with an unusual hint of Italian sausage emanates from the glass. Scents of dark cherries, aged oak, and baking spices also come into play. Surprising and unique to say the least.","Roasted walnuts combine with cocoa, malt, and a touch of marzipan. Dark fruits, light oak, and tobacco round things out. Unusual and gripping, it hugs your tongue as you swish it around. Like the nose, it’s quite robust.","A flash of heat kicks in, then tapers off quickly giving way to sweet flavors of caramel and honey, along with toasted nuts and wet tobacco leaf. The sweet flavors linger, along with a savory tobacco note in the background. Similar to the nose and palate, the finish is unique and intense, allowing the sip to go out with a bang.","American whiskey, as we know it, is dominated by bourbon, and as a result American whiskey drinkers are often bourbon drinkers who find themselves exploring ryes, malts, finished whiskeys, and other whiskeys created by United States based distilleries. Located in Waco, Texas, Balcones “1” is undoubtedly all American, however being a single malt, Balcones “1” is more closely associated with scotch. However, it’s much younger than a typical scotch and aged in new oak barrels compared with scotch’s used barrel aging.

Even considering other American-made malt whiskeys such as Stranahan’s Colorado Whiskey and Westland American Oak Single Malt Whiskey, Balcones “1” is as unique tasting as any. Its relatively high proof delivers the whiskey’s diverse flavor profile with a fierce intensity, although this combination certainly won’t be for everyone.

I’m fortunate to have a bottle of the original Balcones “1” to compare this to. The original “Chip Tate” bottle. Granted, the original bottle has been open since around 2013 when I purchased it, however the differences are surprising. The original is much lighter in color, and veers much closer to chocolate and caramel notes I often find as the backbone of American malt whiskeys, compared to the unique set of flavors found in the recent release of Balcones “1.” Good, bad, or indifferent, the original version is arguably more drinkable, but less complex. Regardless, the comparison further supports my assertion that Balcones “1” is a unique and challenging whiskey that is ideal for those seeking to push the boundaries of a typical American whiskey flavor profile.","The price of Balcones “1” has actually come down since its initial release, from the $90 I paid in 2013 to $70 (or less) you can find it for today. The original version also did not have an age statement, while the current version is stated at 24 months.

There aren’t too many American made single malts at our fingertips either, though the number of options is increasing at a rapid pace, and online availability is helping get them into more hands. As mentioned previously, a few that come to mind are Stranahan’s and Westland American Oak Single Malt Whiskey, with Stranahan’s retailing for a bit less and Wesland a bit more than Balcones. Ages and proofs vary, but relatively speaking the whiskeys fall in the same range. With that being said, the flavor profiles are each quite a bit different from one another, highlighting the fact that price comparisons in the American made single malt space are difficult, as flavor profiles are so varied. To that end, pricing for these unique American made malt whiskeys seems to come at a premium, and Balcones “1” is no exception making it reasonably priced within the marketplace.","Balcones “1” Texas Single Malt offers an intense rush of rich flavors derived from a unique creation style, challenging even the more experienced whiskey drinkers.","Balcones revels in being different, and their products exemplify that. Balcones “1” is a great example of how a unique process serves to deliver a unique flavor profile, and not surprisingly the flavor profile for the brand has morphed over time. As a result, it’s a challenging whiskey that won’t be for everyone, and its relatively high proofpoint amplifies that effect. However, for those looking to push the boundaries of flavor profiles they’re comfortable with, Balcones “1” delivers, albeit at a premium price.",Nick,3,3,3,4,2.5,3,https://www.breakingbourbon.com/review/balcones-1-texas-single-malt
In Depth Review,Barrell Rye Batch 001,Rye,Barrell Craft Spirits,Sourced (From undisclosed distilleries in Indiana & Tennessee),July 2017,117,"4 Years, 6 Months","Undisclosed (Blend of two ryes - one with 51% rye / 49% malted barley and the other with rye, corn, and malted barley in the mashbill)",Copper,$85 (2017),,"Barrell Rye is sourced rye and, like Barrell’s other spirits, will be released periodically in sequentially numbered batches. The company’s mantra is to seek out unique spirits and release them at barrel proof, striving to offer no two batches that are alike. This is the first batch of Rye being released by the company, although some single barrel ryes have already been released in the market. Barrell Rye Batch 001 is not labelled “straight” rye whiskey. While it is actually a blend of straight rye whiskeys, the fact that they’re from multiple states precludes it from being labelled straight. The labelling decision came down to either “a blend of straight ryes” or “rye,” and the company chose the latter.

","The first thing I notice is it’s surprisingly approachable for the proof. The aroma is unexpected, offering a solid base of custard sweetness complemented by a touch of rye spice and a hint of smokiness. It’s full-bodied, but not overpowering. Combined with the welcoming scents, Batch 001 stands out among rye whiskeys.","Sweet cane sugar mingles with a hint of rye spice initially. Warm baked bread, toffee, and butterscotch follow. There’s a maltiness to it that creates a base for the other flavors, rounding everything out. All of these flavors are delivered gently, and nicely balance one another. It’s less potent than the 117 proof would suggest, but still direct. It’s not quite mellow, but it’s not bold either.","Rye spice pops at first, with youthful rye whiskey flavors making a brief appearance. This is quickly overtaken by a sweet, malty flavor I can’t quite pinpoint. While the initial burst of flavors is brief, a delicate sugary-sweet, maltiness lasts for minutes after the sip.","Accordingly to Joe Beatrice, the company’s founder, Rye Batch 001 contains a high amount of rye from MGP that has a mashbill of 51% rye and 49% malted barley. Based on the flavor profile, it’s obvious that this is the predominant component in the blend. The resulting flavor profile offers a new experience that’s still built off of familiar flavors. The rye elements are straightforward, and the malt brings balance to the table. Tasted next to a barrel proof Smooth Ambler Single Barrel Rye and a Thomas H. Handy Rye, the balance Batch 001 offers is even more obvious. Also evident by this comparison is the lack of Batch 001’s WOW factor. I really enjoy the discernible malt characteristics, but this addition seems to tame some flavors as much as it brings something new to the table. I’d wager that some will find it balanced to a fault, while others will revel in its subtle uniqueness.
As this is sourced and blended with barrels from Indiana and Tennessee, and the predominant component is the high barley malt rye from MGP, it’s possible we might see more ryes hit the market with the same MGP mashbill very soon. In talking with Beatrice, the MGP rye on its own was a bit too malty, which prompted the addition of the Tennessee rye to the blend. While the malty characteristic is what makes this rye unique now, only time will tell if the addition of Tennessee rye to Batch 001 might be the dark horse that separates it from the pack in the future.

","Rye whiskeys are becoming increasingly popular and we’re seeing more of them introduced to the market. MGP’s 95% rye whiskey can be very good, but it’s also quite common as it’s bottled under numerous labels. Most rye mashbills are either all rye, close to it, or have almost as much corn as rye in the mashbill. Established companies tend to offer at least one rye in their product portfolios, and they vary from straightforward flavor profiles with mass appeal, to those that offer something unique that might appeal to fewer consumers but push the boundaries of flavor. Craft distilleries are also increasingly experimenting with ryes with varied results. Still, there are far fewer ryes than bourbons to choose from, and barrel proof ryes are even less common. To that end, Barrell’s offering of a unique tasting, nicely blended, limited production barrel proof rye for a premium price of $85 is more than I’d like it to be, but not unreasonable in today’s marketplace. After tasting it, I don’t feel the urge to stockpile it, and because of its unique flavor profile along with its price, it might not be an impulse buy for most.","Barrell brings a solid entrant to the rye whiskey space, offering balance, quality, and a unique flavor profile with their very first batch of rye whiskey.","Barrell has continued to impress me time after time, and this is no exception. While I’m less wowed than I’ve been compared to some of Barrell’s excellent past releases, taking a step back puts this release into perspective. Based on what Barrell has done with their barrel proof bourbons, whiskeys, and even their rum so far, I had hopes of Barrell delivering one of the better ryes I’ve had with this batch. I believe they can do it based on their track record, but realize that placing the target so high for their very first batch of rye was a bit unrealistic on my part. Batch 001 builds off familiar flavors, but offers an end result that tastes different than anything I’ve had. It’s a win for Barrell, and I’m looking forward to the next rye they have to offer.",Nick,3.5,3,3,3.5,2,3,https://www.breakingbourbon.com/review/barrell-rye-batch-001
,Barrell Whiskey Batch 001,Classification: Whiskey,Company: Barrell Craft Spirits,Distillery: Sourced (From an undisclosed distillery in Indiana),Released: July 2015,Proof: 122.5,Age: 7 Years,"Mashbill: Undisclosed amounts of Corn, Rye, and Malted Barley",Color:  Straw,MSRP: $60 (2017),Official Website,"This is a blend of 50% 7 year-old and 50% 8 year-old barrels of whiskey distilled in Indiana from a bourbon mash bill, and aged in Kentucky in used bourbon barrels. The whiskey wasn’t charcoal or chill filtered, instead it was filtered through a coarse particulate filter to remove any charred oak sediments. The mash bill for this whiskey consists of corn, rye, and barley, however exact ratios are not given.

This is the first batch of whiskey released by Barrell Craft Spirits after releasing several batches in their bourbon line.","Before even bringing this up to my nose I’m immediately suspicious of what I just poured. I had to do a triple take as this is an incredibly light colored whiskey, which is reminiscent of a white whiskey aged for just a short time in a new barrel. That being said, the nose reminds me that this isn’t just one step removed from white whiskey.

The nose is surprisingly mellow for a 122.5 proof whiskey, with just the slightest amount of alcohol present. That’s the good news. The bad news is I found myself inhaling hard to distinguish the subtle scents that seemed to settle at the bottom of the glass. Barley, fresh baked bread, toffee, and the ever slightest hints of vanilla and caramel are all present. Not horrible by any means, however for being 122.5 proof I’m shocked that the scents don’t come across deeper than they do, and at how much I really have to work to distinguish the ones that are present.","While the nose didn’t build my confidence, the palate is surprisingly sweet and delivers a really nice taste. The sweetness is comprised of maple syrup, french toast, and powdered sugar that are mixed with pronounced lush dark fruits. These are all topped off by a dab of heat, that allows all the flavors to meld together in a delicious flavor profile. This is one whiskey that you’ll spend awhile on picking apart the various flavor components hidden inside.","The finish starts off really hot and then quickly fades to a mellow heat that dies over the next minute or so. The upfront heat is contained to my mouth and presents with it tastes of watermelon influenced fruit punch. As the heat fades away flavors of fresh marshmallows, dark cherry chocolate, and baked desserts are all noticeable over the next minute or so. From here, the finish mellows out into a one-dimensional flavor that lasts several minutes. This isn’t necessarily a bad thing as I found myself reminiscing of sipping on a cherry cream soda for several minutes after taking a sip.","The company’s mantra is to provide a unique and different whiskey with every batch. While this is their first batch of whiskey and I had nothing to directly compare it to, it has one of the more unique flavor profiles for a whiskey. It isn’t mind blowing, however the palate pairs the sweetness with the dark fruits really well and the finish keeps delivering long after you finish taking a sip. Additionally, very few whiskeys either bourbon or otherwise are bottled at barrel strength and are neither charcoal or chill filtered.

I went back and added a few drops of water after my tasting to see how it affected the whiskey. The water actually muted the initial flavors a little bit while shortening the finish. This is one whiskey that I’d definitely recommend you drink for a little bit before considering adding any water or ice to it. The 122.5 proof is very manageable and not nearly as “strong” as you’d expect from a whiskey this high in alcohol.","Coming in at $60 for a NDP whiskey aged in used bourbon barrels, this certainly isn’t an inexpensive whiskey. You’re getting a blended whiskey from an undisclosed source that looks like it was aged for a few months let alone the 7-8 years it actually spent in the barrel. That being said, there also aren’t that many unique tasting barrel proof whiskeys on the market that offer a manageable amount of low heat along with an approachable flavor profile. While not the best deal on the market, there are certainly many worse whiskeys available out there for a similar or even higher price. When you look at it that way, $60 doesn’t seem too bad after all.","Don’t let its incredibly light color fool you, Barrell Whiskey Batch 001 delivers a delicious palate and well rounded finish that will delight your taste buds."," If you’re looking for a more affordable substitute to Barrell’s outstanding bourbon batches 005 and 006 which were released around the same time, look elsewhere. While good in its own right, it’s in no way in the outstanding category of its two big brothers. Is it an unfair comparison to make? Quite possibly, however it’s one that will inevitably take place due to the fact that these were all released around the same time.

What Barrell Whiskey does deliver is a unique whiskey alternative to the likes of similarly priced barrel proof bourbons. It’s an approachable whiskey that most high proof lovers will enjoy and delivers just enough discerning flavor elements to hold people’s interest while they contemplate what they’re drinking. This is a good first attempt by Barrell Craft Spirits into non-bourbon whiskey, and sets a nice base for them to build off of in the future.

,Basil Hayden's Dark Rye,Classification: Distilled Spirits Specialties (Kentucky Straight Rye Whiskey Blended with Canadian Whiskey and Port),Company: Beam Suntory,Distillery: Jim Beam,Released: September 2017,Proof: 80,Age: NAS,Mashbill: Undisclosed,Color: Dark Ruby,MSRP: $40 (2017),Official Website,"Basil Hayden’s Dark Rye 2017 is the second expansion in the Basil Hayden’s family, following Basil Hayden’s Rye. This release is made by blending Kentucky rye, Canadian rye (Alberta Distillery), and California port together. Jim Beam has announced that this will be the first ever permanent addition to the Basil Hayden’s family.","Fresh oak and dark berries dance in the forefront. Beneath are fresh baked fruit turnover, rye spice, and a hint of green apple. While the scents aren’t the rye notes I was expecting, they’re quite inviting and and set the tone for just how different this blended rye is going to be.","There’s a clear influence from the port on the palate. It’s sweet, consisting of a big bowl of berries and plums with a hint of vanilla dominating the sip. It’s far from dry, with the best way of describing this palate as juicy. The rye is drowned out as the port influence clearly dominates. That said, this is dangerously easy to sip due to its sweet flavor profile and low proof.","If you love classic rye finishes, you’ve come to the wrong place, as the port continues to impact here too. The dark berries found in the palate linger, and carry through the entire finish. Adding to them is a nuttiness that is combined with white pepper and oak. There’s a very light hint of rye spice, but it’s easily overpowered by the other flavors. Unfortunately, the funky nutty taste lingers long after the other other flavors and overstays its welcome. Frankly the finish is a letdown compared to the nose and palate.","It’s becoming more and more common to see flavored “whiskey liqueurs” that are under 80 proof points. Wild Turkey and Evan Williams are good examples of this, having released various honey, cinnamon, and other infused whiskeys. What’s not common is the practice of major U.S. whiskey distillers directly adding other alcohol types, like wine, to their mix of 80 proof plus spirits. This practice could be construed as a distillery taking the easy route when it comes to flavoring, or worse, trying to hide a flawed product with a stronger flavoring agent.

As one of the largest and longest established distilleries, it’s ironic that Beam embraces the direct addition of port, as opposed to finishing the rye in wine barrels. I might expect this from an upstart distillery working with a minimal budget and trying to be unique, but not necessarily a large and established one. Past products including Jim Beam Signature Craft Rare Spanish Brandy which has Spanish brandy added to the mix and Alberta Rye Whiskey Dark Batch. The latter is made up of a mix of 100% Canadian rye, Old Grand Dad, and Spanish sherry (91% rye whiskey, 8% bourbon, and 1% sherry). These products share similar traits as Basil Hayden’s Dark Rye, in that the added spirit is extremely noticeable much more so than you might find in typical barrel finished products.

In the end, just because Beam goes the route of adding the port directly to Basil Hayden’s Dark Rye doesn’t mean that they’re necessarily doing anything wrong. Yes it will deliver a flavor profile that won’t please everyone, but it’s also a fascinating example of how the addition of another spirit can influence a mass produced whiskey versus barrel aging or barrel finishing. While I don’t advocate for this becoming a trend anytime soon, it’s a unique way to bottle a whiskey, and one that provides a flavor profile unlike almost anything else currently on the market.","It’s hard to judge the value of a whiskey when it has so few similar competitors. $40 for a blended rye that has port added to it may sound like a lot, but in this case, I feel that it’s actually priced quite reasonably. In today's marketplace where anything labeled as a limited yearly release seems to be marked up beyond necessity, Jim Beam has decided to keep this reasonably priced. With Dark Rye coming in at the same MSRP as Basil Hayden’s Bourbon, it’s a great experiment by Beam to price an outside-the-box release at an everyman's price. This is the opposite route of what competitors do, such as the yearly Brown-Forman release of their limited edition Woodford Master’s Collection for $100. Even Beam does this with their own Knob Creek line when it comes to limited editions. While in the end this bourbon might not be worth paying much more than a few dollars over MSRP due to the funky finish, it’s incredibly refreshing to see the price point Jim Beam landed on this one.","Basil Hayden’s Dark Rye’s unique blend just goes to show that even in today’s crowded marketplace, there's always room to try something different and still be successful.","Based on the fact that past Beam releases that contained spirits directly blended in, did so at a similar/lesser rate, it can be assumed that the majority of this blend is rye with a very small percentage of port blended in. With that in mind, it’s really interesting to see how much influence the addition of such a small amount of port has on this rye whiskey. The flavor profile heavily leans on the port influence throughout the entire sip.

I’d be remiss if I didn’t state that this unique tasting whiskey won’t please everyone. Some will be turned off by the fact that port is directly blended with the rye, others will bemoan the lack of traditional rye flavors, and yet others will say it was good right up until the finish. That said, I find the end result to be quite unique. It’s refreshing in today’s ever-crowded and ever-similar marketplace. In addition, I’m pleased to see that Beam decided to come in at a price point that allows everyone to give this release a try to judge for themselves.",Jordan,3,3,2,4,3,3,https://www.breakingbourbon.com/review/basil-hydens-dark-rye
,Blade and Bow 22 Year,Classification: Straight Bourbon,Company: Diageo,Distillery: Undisclosed,Released: April 2018,Proof: 92,Age: 22 Years,Mashbill: Undisclosed,Color:  Copper,MSRP: $250 (2018),Official Website,"This year’s Blade and Bow 22 Year honors the 83rd anniversary of the opening of the Stitzel-Weller Distillery. While no source distillery information was released for this year’s bottle, past releases have been a blend of bourbon from Buffalo Trace and the Bernheim Distillery (now Heaven Hill), and one can assume that this is the same stock that was used before. Diageo states that the bourbon was most recently aged and bottled at Stitzel-Weller, however no time frame was given and it’s possible that this was likely aged outside of the Stitzel-Weller facility for the majority of its life. The bourbon will only be re-released in Kentucky, New York, Illinois, California, Texas, Colorado, South Carolina, Georgia, Louisiana, Washington, D.C., Tennessee, North Carolina, Virginia, Oregon, and the Stitzel-Weller Distillery.","The age is apparent from the moment I bring the glass to my nose. Aged oak, clove, cinnamon, and leather are present. Digging in deeper hints of orange cake, baking spices, and nutmeg appear. The scents all blend together quite nicely and provide a complex experience that begs for additional nosings.","Sweet on the tongue, the palate starts off with a dose of orange Jello, brown sugar, caramel, and a hint of vanilla. Beneath the sweeter flavor notes are subtle hints of the higher age, predominantly leather and a dash of white pepper. The mouthfeel is thin for such an old bourbon. The palate isn’t bad per say, it just surprises you with a more youthful sip than expected, especially considering the way the nose tees up this bourbon.","The time spent in the barrel shines through in the finish. Oak, leather, a hint of tobacco, and cigar box intertwine right from the start. That said, none of the flavors are overpowering or overdone which is pleasantly surprising to see for a bourbon this old. What is somewhat disappointing though is the finish lingers for only a short while with just the oak and cigar box remaining.","From a flavor prospective, Blade and Bow 22 Year is nothing like its younger sibling which shares its name. While the standard no age statement (NAS) Blade and Bow is light and youthful with more fruit notes coming through, Blade and Bow 22 Year delivers a deeper overall experience, which should be expected considering it’s been resting in the barrel for 22 years and is sourced from a different distillery.

For such an old bourbon it delivers a surprisingly drinkable experience. The expected oak notes are present, however they don’t overpower and instead only help to enhance the experience. While this was unexpected to find, the palate throws a hiccup into the experience. I can’t remember another 20 year-plus bourbon that delivers an appropriate nose and finish with such a thin sweet tasting palate.","The price of Blade and Bow 22 Year continues to rise as the years go on. When it was first released in 2015 the price was $150. Just three years later it’s nearly doubled to $250. In today’s booming marketplace, a 22 year old bourbon selling for $250 should seem like a reasonable price. Other age stated bourbons continue to climb in price and very few expressions are 20 years or older on the market. However very few doesn’t mean none at all.

Barterhouse is a great example of a 20 year age stated bourbon from an undisclosed distillery, at almost the same proof, that sells for under $100. While not a true apples to apples comparison, it’s pretty darn close. In my opinion it doesn’t have as fulfilling of a nose that Blade and Bow 22 Year delivers, however overall, Barterhouse delivers an almost equally good drinking experience for half the cost. It makes sense that Diageo would want to increase the price as their supply dwindles. While Blade and Bow 22 Year delivers a good drinking experience, that doesn’t mean it gets a pass on the price. Yes it’s a very limited release with a 22 year age statement that some folks will buy no matter the price, but for those looking to drink this, there are better options on the market for less.",Blade and Bow 22 Year shows hints of greatness that come up just a bit short due to its lower proof.,"An age stated whiskey above 20 years old is a rarity. One that’s drinkable without being over-oaked is rarer still. Blade and Bow 22 Year is a good bourbon that feels like it’s on the edge of great potential. The nose is really solid and gives you high hopes for a great tasting experience. Unfortunately the palate seems like it was proofed down just a little too much for its own good and while the finish improves, it never reaches the same level as the nose.

I would love to see what Blade and Bow 22 Year tastes like about 10 proof points higher. It delivers an experience that you know can be improved and is so close to doing so. It leaves me only wondering what Diageo could do for future releases if they just took a chance. A special 85th anniversary release anyone?",Jordan,3.5,2.5,3,3,2,3,https://www.breakingbourbon.com/review/blade-and-bow-22-year
,Booker's Bourbon,Classification: Straight Bourbon,Company: Beam Suntory,Distillery: Jim Beam,Released: Ongoing,Proof: 128.5,"Age: 6 Years, 2 Months","Mashbill: 77% Corn, 13% Rye, 10% Malted Barley",Color:  Amber,MSRP: $70 (2017),Official Website,"Barrel Proof, Batch #C06-K-8: Fredrick Booker Noe II was Jim Beam’s grandson and the master distiller at Jim Beam from 1965 -1992.  He’s also the namesake of Booker’s Bourbon. Booker's Bourbon first came to be when Booker would hand select barrels to give as holiday gifts for friends. Eventually the popularity of these bottles caught on and Beam started to bottle in mass. Booker’s was launched in 1988 as the first mass produced bourbon bottled straight from the barrel, uncut and unfiltered. After retiring in 1992, Booker went on to work as an ambassador for the company and traveled the world promoting Beam bourbon until he died in 2004.

Booker’s bourbon ranges in proof between 121-131 and is aged 6-8 yrs. It’s the highest proof bourbon in the Jim Beam small batch collection.","On first whiff, I got a strong upfront alcohol burn, which is common for barrel proof bourbons. Behind it lingers the smell of oak, light floral notes, and a solid nutty scent. The smell alone tells you to sit down and buckle up!  This isn’t a bourbon to be taken lightly.","Wow - is this a sweet tasting bourbon…both literally and figuratively! For such a high proof, I was very surprised at how nice the mouthfeel was on this. You get a quick upfront hit of the sugars from the wood, along with hints of vanilla and raisin. Right after that initial taste, my mouth was instantly warmed, as I could feel the heat of the bourbon quickly encompassing every corner of my mouth. This then morphed into the taste of aged wood and light leather.","Booker's delivered a long light lingering finish. The flavor burst you get from the palate all but disappears and instead you’re left with a light vanilla and fresh new wood finish. I was surprised I wasn’t blown away with a bold finish considering this bourbon had so much bite up front in the initial palate. Instead, I found myself going back for more and more sips just to capture some additional flavor.","While Booker's may have been the first mass produced barrel proof bourbon to hit the market, barrel proof bourbons are more common now than when Booker's was first introduced. Between many of the Buffalo Trace products, Heaven Hill releases, and a multitude of craft distillers, one can easily find a barrel proof bourbon to try. That being said, Booker's has been able to consistently deliver a quality product year after year. While preferences may vary by batch, you can count on a great barrel proof bourbon with every bottle.","While not necessarily inexpensive, Booker's does a nice job of delivering value to the consumer. You get barrel proof bourbon that’s full of flavor and easy enough to drink at a high proof. It’s slightly more than what you would pay for a Stagg Jr. or an Elijah Craig Barrel Proofbottle. However, you can find Booker's on the shelf any day of the week, versus having to camp out outside of a liquor store to find one of the aforementioned bottles.",The original barrel proof bourbon stands up to the test of time.,"Clocking in at 128.5 proof, Booker's allows you to experiment at home by adding as much or as little water as you want until you get to a profile that’s just right for you. After completing the tasting, I added a few drops of water to my glass. While the water didn’t significantly change the nose or palate for me, I did notice a very slight hint of fresh cut grass coming out on the finish. While I didn’t notice much improvement with just a few drops of water, that doesn’t mean you should avoid adding it to this one if you feel it’s too high in proof for your liking.

Booker's surprised me at how easy it was to sip for being barrel proof. The sweet taste was really nice and quite enjoyable. Sure there’s better barrel proof bourbons on the market, but it’s nice to know that any day of the week you can walk into a liquor store and pick up a bottle of Booker's and enjoy it when the mood hits you.",Jordan,2.5,3.5,2,3.5,3,3,https://www.breakingbourbon.com/review/bookers-bourbon
,Bourbon & Brew,Classification: Finished Whiskey (Bourbon finished with an oak spiral and natural flavors),Company: Sanctified Spirits,Distillery: MGP,Release Date: January 2020,Proof: 90,Age: NAS (Website states 2 years),Mashbill: Undisclosed,Color: Mahogany,Price: $55 (2020),Official Website,"Oak & Eden was founded in April 2017 by brothers Joe and Jamie Giildenzopf and Brad Neathery. In May 2018 they launched their first product, and now offer a variety of different whiskeys. Each is finished in a unique way - a five inch long wood spiral, which the company refers to as the “Spire,” is added to each bottle to finish it. For Bourbon & Brew, each spire was soaked in cold brew coffee from the Delagua Farm in Columbia which was created by Oak & Eden in collaboration with West Oak Coffee out of Denton, Texas. Oak & Eden does not always disclose where they source their whiskeys from besides stating on their website that they use a “handful of carefully selected distilleries in America” and then go on to say “namely MGP."" The bourbon used as the base for Bourbon & Brew was sourced from MGP.","The nose is noticeably astringent, with an almost tannic undertone that seems to permeate what are otherwise nice aromas. Faint yet inviting scents of port wine, chocolate, and roasting coffee beans try to fight their way through. While the possibility of greatness seems within reach, the overpowering astringency doesn’t allow the nose to reach its potential.","While the nose offers a mixed experience, this finished whiskey immediately shines as soon as you take a sip. Cocoa, caramel chews, graham cracker, tobacco, and port wine mingle together, with a noticeable nuttiness rounding things out. It’s akin to a very high proof caramel porter in its delivery, offering a fullness of flavor that’s surprisingly delicious, especially at only 90 proof.","Caramel porter notes taper out, with brown sugar sweetness and echoes of savory tobacco lingering. There is a noticeable lack of spice throughout the sip, and the finish proves to be more in line with the rich palate than the nose. Overall a very interesting and dynamic sip.","The base for Bourbon & Brew is a 2 year old MGP bourbon. While young bourbon has become quite prevalent, the combination of bourbon and coffee is not, and neither is including an oak spire right inside the bottle. Each spire included inside every bottle of Bourbon & Brew was soaked in cold brew coffee from the Delagua Farm in Columbia that was created by Oak & Eden in collaboration with West Oak Coffee out of Denton, Texas.

While purists will scowl and chalk this up as a gimmick, the end product proves otherwise making for a unique tasting product that’s quite unlike any other bourbons on my shelf. With that being said, the youthful notes of the 2 year old bourbon are noticeably detrimental to the potential of this combination, especially in the nose. It’s a great proof of concept, and makes me curious what the combination of a higher aged bourbon or spicy rye combined with coffee flavors might taste like.","There are plenty of non-distiller producer brands sourcing bourbon, and the age of that bourbon has trended younger as demand has increased. What matters is not the age, but what the company does next to differentiate their product. Is it a story, a fancy label, careful single barrel selection, meticulous blending, something more, or something less? In this case the unique concept of combining coffee with bourbon, and by delivering that union via an immersed wooden spire, makes Bourbon & Brew worthy of your attention. However, the premium price tag is also worth questioning, especially as this will be a polarizing flavor profile among consumers. Considering the onslaught of very similar flavor profiles among brands, Bourbon & Brew commands a higher price tag simply because its unique flavor profile delivers an interesting and dynamic sip that really stands out. These concepts, however, are easily replicated, so the key here was beating others to the punch. At $55, this unique limited release is worth exploring for anyone who appreciates finished whiskey with a twist and doesn’t mind a premium price tag.","Bourbon & Brew may be gimmicky on the surface, but in a sea of similar whiskeys, its unique bourbon and coffee bottle finishing concept and even more unique flavor profile stands out in today’s marketplace.","As is the case with many finished whiskeys, I expect Bourbon & Brew to be just as polarizing. Similar to the overly sweet notes found with Angel’s Envy Caribbean Rum Finished Rye, Bourbon & Brews coffee notes will certainly wow some and disgust others. Adding the oak spire directly to the bottle is definitely a risk, as the spire will continue to impart flavor over time, likely lending to variation in flavor from bottle to bottle and month to month. While an older base whiskey could have tapered some of the offputting notes found predominantly in the nose, I found the experience a welcome departure from the norm. Bourbon & Brew is definitely worth a shot if you’re in search of something different.

,Bowman Brothers Small Batch,Classification: Straight Bourbon,Company: Sazerac Company Inc.,Distillery: A. Smith Bowman Distillery,Released: Ongoing,Proof: 90,Age: NAS (Press materials state between 6-7 years),Mashbill: Undisclosed,Color:  Straw,MSRP: $33 (2017),Official Website,"John, Abraham, Joseph, and Isaac Bowman were Virginia militia officers in the American Revolutionary War. In 1779, they led 30 pioneer families to Madison Family County, Kentucky and established Bowman’s Station. Their great, great grandson, Abram S. Bowman, purchased Sunset Hills estate farm located in northern Virginia in 1929. Following the repeal of Prohibition, he found himself with an excess of corn, wheat, and rye by 1935 and opened a distillery on the property. The current A. Smith Bowman Distillery is located about 60 miles from the original distillery in Spotsylvania County, Virginia. It opened in 1988 and began distilling spirits in the 1991.

A. Smith Bowman Distillery was purchased by the Sazerac Company, Inc. in 2003. Currently the company doesn’t produce their own whiskey distillate and doesn’t disclose who they source it from. It is believed the new make they use originates from Buffalo Trace and is their #1 mashbill. Bowman Brothers Small Batch is triple distilled but it’s unclear how many times A. Smith Bowman re-distills it through their unique copper still. The company then ages the whiskey onsite. Bowman Brothers Small Batch consists of eight barrel batches and according to press materials is typically aged between 6-7 years.","A welcoming aroma of brown sugar, sweet cinnamon, oak, and a twinge of floral potpourri. A quick swirl of the glass brings forth a bouquet of additional sweet notes of candy apple, peach, and custard. It’s a pleasant nose with a fair amount of complexity that surprised me quite a bit.","Its oily and thick mouthfeel is immediately noticeable. Vanilla, toffee, roasted nuts, and toasted oak hit with medium intensity. Despite having sweeter flavors, the palate is quite dry overall, and keeps the sweet flavors in check. It’s a little rough around the edges, but has a decent core.","Quite a bit of spiciness that makes it seem as if someone dropped a jalapeno in my glass. This isn’t a hot finish, but a spicy one. Toasted oak, black pepper, and red pepper flakes dominate. It’s not spicy to the point of clearing your sinuses, but more of a fiery blast with a long fallout. It’s a bit more interesting than it is delicious, but overall, wow.","Starting with sweet and floral notes with the nose, oily and thick mouthfeel on the palate, and ending on a uniquely spicy finish, this is one heck of a ride. I just didn’t expect this from a 90 proof, 6-7 year old $33 bourbon. The company was able to take a sourced distillate and create a product that’s all their own. This is not an easy task, and many non-distiller producers try and fail to do it all the time. For all of A. Smith Bowman’s marketing speak of “triple distillation,” “copper still,” “aged in Virginia rickhouses,” these aspects seem to have had an actual impact on the final product.","This is a bourbon where its uniqueness really plays into its value. Many bourbons try and offer something unique in the $30 price range, but in reality, this price range is often a catch-all for average barrels. When a company is producing thousands of barrels and batching them in huge numbers, more times than not, the end result is one that lacks a good deal of character. That is certainly not an issue here. There's little doubt of Bowman Brothers Small Batch’s wealth of character and overall quality for its price. In the end though, a good deal of its additional value will lean on how heavily someone enjoys its unique traits.",Bowman Brothers Small Batch escaped being an average bourbon by offering just enough distinction from other average bourbons to make it stand out.,"Sometimes it’s easy to forget that being unique doesn’t necessarily guarantee something will be great. Bowman Brothers Small Batch is certainly a mixed bag of tricks. Of course being unique comes with its risks because there is a good chance you might not instantly fall in love with it, or worse, immediately hate it. First time drinkers might turn their nose up to it, while more experienced drinkers might appreciate its more curious traits. But anything that sets its own course and offers something different should be celebrated. You may not love it due to its unique traits, but there's a good chance when you want to switch it up, Bowman Brothers Small Batch will be on your short list to do just that.

The rumor is it's between 8-10 years, usually 9.5 years)",Mashbill: Undisclosed,Color:  Amber,MSRP: $30 (2017),Official Website,"Buffalo Trace bourbon came about when visitors to the newly named and renovated Buffalo Trace Distillery in 1999 asked, “Why isn’t there a bourbon called ‘Buffalo Trace?’” Amy Preske, a PR manager from Sazerac told us, “Ultimately, after discussions with Elmer [T. Lee], it was decided that [he] would go into the best floors in the best warehouses and find some of the finest barrels we had of an older whiskey that really matched up with his views on what a full bodied, robust character, Kentucky straight bourbon whiskey should taste like. The result was what consumers enjoy today – Buffalo Trace!” The brand was released to the market in 1999 and is made from their “#1” mashbill, which is thought to be made of 10% or less rye. According to Buffalo Trace’s website, the bourbon is batched from no more than 40 barrels at a time and is aged on the middle floors of various warehouses where it experiences the most temperature changes.","Instantly likeable and pleasant with notes of caramel, honey, orange, and vanilla. The nose balances these flavors well while also providing an underlying layer of oak and mint.","Sweet and mellow with notes of brown sugar, vanilla, and toffee. The palate might be too sweet for some, but probably very enjoyable for most. Light amounts of oak and rye spice round out the palate.",A moderate length finish with oak at the forefront. The finish really opens up and develops and ultimately ends by filling your nostrils.  It’s a very interesting and full flavored finish for a 90 proof bourbon.,"Buffalo Trace Bourbon doesn’t have a flavor profile that screams unique, and that’s probably by design. Buffalo Trace Distillery doesn’t disclose the exact mashbill for their flagship brand, but we do know it’s low on rye (10% or less) and that George T. Stagg, Eagle Rare, and E.H. Taylor Small Batch are made from the same recipe. What makes Buffalo Trace Bourbon unique is that for a lower priced bourbon it doesn’t taste “cheap.” Additionally, it’s surprisingly robust for a 90 proof bourbon. It’s not trying to be the most unique bourbon at the party, just one that everyone gets along with at the party.","As with any low priced bourbon, there are different types of drinkers to speak value to. For people using it as a mixing bourbon, its full flavor mixes well without losing many of the bourbon's characteristics, and it’s probably priced right around the max of what they want to spend. As a sipper, no matter what experience you may have drinking whiskey straight, anyone can enjoy drinking this one. The quality and flavor of Buffalo Trace is always far better than you’d expect from a $25 bottle of bourbon.","Buffalo Trace is the quintessential bourbon -  smooth, well balanced, and extremely drinkable.","Everything about this bourbon feels like it’s been masterfully engineered to be the perfect example of what a bourbon should be. It’s hard to find any faults with this one and that’s by design. A flagship brand needs to appeal to everyone while maintaining a good value. Sometimes that description can bring with it a negative connotation since mass appeal and quality doesn’t always go hand in hand. In this case, Buffalo Trace Bourbon is a solid bourbon that will appeal to any level of whiskey drinker. For someone new to bourbon, it’s extremely accessible with its sweet nose and palate, and a finish that introduces a perfect mix of oak and spice. Although it may not challenge a seasoned bourbon drinker’s developed palate, they’ll still appreciate its overall quality and great value. This could easily become anyone’s everyday bourbon.",Eric,3.5,3,3,2.5,3.5,3,https://www.breakingbourbon.com/review/buffalo-trace-bourbon
,Bulleit 95 Rye 12 Year,Classification: Straight Rye,Company: Diageo,Distillery: MGP Ingredients,Release Date: April 2019,Proof: 92,Age: 12 Years,"Mashbill: 95% Rye, 5% Malted Barley",Color: Light Copper,MSRP: $50,Official Website,"Bulleit introduced 95 Rye Frontier Whiskey as a permanent line extension in 2011. Despite being produced by MGP Ingredients, Bulleit has a unique agreement with the company for them to produce rye whiskey from a proprietary recipe. Bulliet has control over barrel maturation which is done at MGP and at Bulleit’s own warehouses. Bulleit 95 Rye 12 Year, or “Bulleit Rye 12 Year” as it is typically referred to, is the first extension of Bulleit’s rye brand and is currently only available in select markets: Washington D.C., CO, IL, NY, OH, OR, CA, KY, TX, GA, NJ, AZ, MA, and MD. The oft used “95” in the name, refers to the 95% rye in its mashbill.","Punchy out of the glass, with heavy baking spices, strawberry cream, mild dill, cocoa powder, and slight hints of grass. It is much more potent than I expected and the depth of the aroma is surprising. It’s an interesting blend of scents that work well together.","A very grounded array of flavors that’s heavy on oak, brown sugar, spice, and molasses. Some floral, semi-sweet chocolate, and graham cracker notes are also present, but have minor influence on the overall flavor profile.","This is where the whiskey’s age shows most, as oak dominates resulting in a finish that flirts with a bitter and tannic aftertaste. This is a bit disappointing as the finish is relatively simple and suggests the age did more to harm the whiskey than to enhance it.","The most obvious standout trait of this release is its 12 year age statement. It’s incredibly rare for a rye to even boast an age statement, let alone one with an impressive 12 years behind it. With so many brands sourcing their rye from MGP, you’d think more would have them. This might be due to MGP’s shortage of aged rye stock. Although what’s more interesting is that Bulleit is the brand that actually has it, which might be the result of the company’s long standing relationship with MGP, and why other brands have looked to Tennessee distilleries for aged rye stock.

Of course an age statement means nothing if it does little to change, enhance, or transform the baseline whiskey it comes from. The standard Bulleit Rye is a no-frills rye, for better or for worse. It’s unoffensive, not all that memorable, but quite drinkable and extremely crushable (if that’s your thing). Comparing the two, the standard Bulleit Rye’s flavor profile resides on a higher octave, with lighter, brighter, and sweeter flavors. In contrast, the 12 Year is on a lower octave with deeper flavors, more oak, and additional weight to its mouthfeel. The 12 Year isn’t light-years ahead of the standard version, but it will most likely appeal to bourbon enthusiasts with its richer flavor profile that is more conducive to drinking neat.","Age stated rye whiskeys are quite elusive in today’s whiskey market. Of the few that sport them, they are often reserved for limited releases or single barrels, and command a premium price. It’s quite refreshing to see Diageo release this 12 year old rye at a price you probably would have expected a few years ago, let alone in 2019. The company could have easily released this as an annual limited release and asked double for it. Perhaps this is a sign of whiskey companies starting to pull back from demanding top dollar for every new release despite whether the product warrants it or not. Quite frankly, this would have sat on the shelves at $100, but at $50 and with wide availability (after its full rollout), this should result in decent sales. Not everyone will love its 92 proof, but Diageo probably wanted to hit this price point and achieve maximum drinkability for all. I’m sure many would have loved to see this over 100 proof, but at 92, many will find this a satisfying pour and a great value for its age.","A rye with a flavor profile and age statement that's increasingly rare to find in today’s marketplace, all at a great price.","Bulleit Rye 12 Year may not be as unique tasting as Old Forester Rye, or hit quite the same mark as Knob Creek Limited Edition Rye, but it offers an oak heavy rye and is tonally different than most ryes on the market. A thicker mouthfeel and a flavor profile that errs more on the dark end of the spectrum, there aren’t many ryes that taste like Bulleit 12 Year Rye. But that doesn’t necessarily make it a homerun either. Most noticeably, the lack of fruit notes and some bitterness on the finish holds it back the most. Despite this, Bulleit 12 Year Rye offers enough uniqueness and value that justifies its place among ryes in the marketplace.",Eric,3.5,3,2,3.5,3.5,3,https://www.breakingbourbon.com/review/bulleit-95-rye-12-year
,Chattanooga Whiskey 91,Classification: Straight Bourbon,Company: Chattanooga Whiskey Co.,Distillery: Chattanooga Riverfront Distillery,Release Date: August 2019,Proof: 91,Age: 2 Years,"Mashbill: Yellow Corn, Malted Rye, Caramel Malted Barley & Honey Malted Barley (exact percentages not disclosed)",Color: Copper,MSRP: $35 (2019),Official Website,"In 2011, Chattanooga Whiskey became the first legal distillery in Chattanooga in over 100 years. In 2019, the distillery produced two new signature expressions, Chattanooga Whiskey 91 and Chattanooga Whiskey CASK 111. The company states that the signature recipe - known as “Barrel 91” - for Chattanooga Whiskey 91 was selected by Head Distiller Grant McCracken from the first 100 experimental barrels created at the Chattanooga Whiskey Experimental Distillery.

Chattanooga Whiskey 91 is a four grain straight bourbon consisting of corn and three distinct malts, which the company labels a Tennessee High Malt whiskey. The bourbon is aged for at least 2 years in two different charred and toasted white oak barrels before undergoing a Solera finishing process. For the Solera finishing, the company brings together almost 100 barrels into a 4,000-gallon, charred, white oak Solera finishing barrel, which never goes empty. Each batch size of Chattanooga Whiskey 91 consists of 8-12 barrels in total. The bottle being reviewed comes from batch number 19F17R.","The nose opens with a large dose of malted grains that builds a base atop of a mingling of oak, Bing cherries, sweet bread, brown sugar. The scents presented are nicely balanced and are a pleasant way to start the sip.","Brown sugar and malted grains are immediately noticeable. The lower proof makes this bourbon easy to roll around your mouth, and in doing so, further reveals aged oak, leather, and a touch of vanilla. It’s an overall simple, yet enjoyable palate.","Leather, oak, a hint of malt, and white pepper start off the finish and transition to dry oak. The finish is short, and while a fine way to end the sip, it doesn’t convey the same level of depth as the nose and palate.","Chattanooga Whiskey 91 is a rare oddity in today’s marketplace. It’s a predominantly malted bourbon that utilizes a Solera process and is finally batched in a 8-12 barrel size volume. Oh and it comes from Tennessee - not exactly a combination you see every day.

From a flavor perspective, Chattanooga Whiskey 91 tastes like what you expect from a malted bourbon. The Solera process, or more accurately their version of it which is a hybrid of vating and a true solera process, helps to provide an end result that tastes a lot older than the bourbon’s actual age. This process also allows for more consistency, yet still allows unique flavors between batches. Combined, these traits allow Chattanooga Whiskey 91 to stand out amongst the crowd.","Coming in at $35, Chattanooga Whiskey 91 is a rarity in today’s marketplace on two fronts. It’s one of the least expensive Solera aged whiskeys you can find on the market. While others, such as Blade & Bow and Hillrock Estate Solera Aged Bourbon are both priced under a hundred dollars and undergo a more true Solera aging system as compared with Chattanooga's hybrid version, neither can compete with Chattanooga Whiskey Co.’s price.

Additionally, this is one of the more inexpensive bourbons from a newer distillery that you’ll find on the market. Often upstart distilleries price their bourbon at $40 or more. While there are exceptions, many younger distilleries aren’t aging their product as long or are aging their whiskey in smaller barrels. For $35, Chattanooga Whiskey 91 delivers a great value for what they offer.","A unique “Tennessee High Malt Whiskey,” Chattanooga Whiskey 91 is a bourbon that delivers a fair balance of flavors at a reasonable price.","Chattanooga Whiskey 91 is a nice introduction to what the distillery declares to be a Tennessee High Malt Whiskey. It delivers a mostly well-balanced sip that at only 91 proof, is flavorful and easy to enjoy. Additionally, Chattanooga Whiskey 91 provides an inexpensive way for those that haven’t tried a high malted bourbon before to try one without breaking the bank. It’s a bourbon worth seeking out for those looking to switch things up from a more traditionally made and tasting bourbon.

,Chattanooga Whiskey 99 Rye,Classification: Straight Rye,Company: Chattanooga Whiskey Co.,Distillery: Chattanooga Riverfront Distillery,Release Date: Ongoing,Proof: 99,Age: 3 Years,"Mashbill: Malted Rye, Yellow Corn, Caramel Malted Rye, Caramel Malted Barley (exact percentages not disclosed)",Color: Mahogany,MSRP: $40 (2020),Official Website,"In 2011, Chattanooga Whiskey became the first legal distillery in Chattanooga, Tennessee in over 100 years. In 2019, the distillery produced two signature expressions, Chattanooga Whiskey 91 and Chattanooga Whiskey CASK 111. The company also has an Experimental Collection in which they test different distilling techniques, grains, barrels, and blends in extremely small batches. So far, 24 bottles have been released in the series.

The company’s 99 Rye is the newest ongoing standard release and joins Chattanooga Whiskey 91 and Chattanooga Whiskey CASK 111 as the company’s standard Tennessee High Malt collection. According to Grant McCraken, head distiller at Chattanooga Whiskey, the company started development of it in 2015 and its first iteration was released as part of their Experimental Collection as Batch 007 “Tennessee Rye Malt.” The majority of the company’s rye grain comes from Canada that is sprouted and kiln roasted for about 24 hours with temperatures reaching about 170-180F. The other two malts in the mashbill are roasted at temperatures around 250-300F. From there, the company uses processes that are meant to highlight the rye malt with longer and cooler fermentations (~7 days at ~78F top temp), lower still proofs (133 off doubler), lower barreling proofs (115), and a barrel char that is a classic #4. 99 Rye is made in batches of 6-10 barrels.","A soft leaning aroma nicely showcases orange creamsicle, malt, and pine at the start. It’s not overly complex, yet this combination of scents works really well together. Spice is held in check by a gentle sweetness that helps make it stand out. Contrasting notes of honey and cayenne add conflict in an otherwise straightforward and satisfying aroma.","A medium intensity of toasted graham cracker, cherry cola, and spice provides an enjoyable collection of flavors that leans more sweet than spicy. An injection of citrus, baking spice, and malt help add additional layers of complexity. Unique but not shockingly so given its all malted mashbill, this rye’s flavor profile is interesting and fun.","The whiskey’s rye grain comes alive in the traditional sense during its finish. A drastic ramp up in heat occurs with rye spice, cinnamon, and nutmeg. A lingering apple cider aftertaste takes over and when combined with the warmth of its heat, transforms it into an almost hot toddy tasting experience. The whiskey’s toasted grains also leave a mellow aftertaste that stands out as unique for a rye whiskey.","With Chattanooga Whiskey 99 Rye being a rye malt whiskey (at least 51% rye malt) instead of just a high malt rye, it introduces a more complex distilling process and flavor profile. Rather than blending a rye whiskey with malted barley like many rye whiskeys on the market, a rye malt whiskey malts the actual rye grain. This results in an array of flavors not typically associated with a traditional rye whiskey.

Rye’s usual spiciness and baking spice related notes are still present in 99 Rye, but there’s a whole other side of the whiskey that works to contrast and balance against it. In 99 Rye’s case, that includes toasted graham crackers, cola, and more sweetness. With the other part of its mashbill including a blend of slow toasted and drum roasted rye malt, it introduces a subtle but effective toasted aftertaste to the whiskey. While Chattanooga Whiskey isn’t the first to malt rye grain, there are few distilleries doing it, and even fewer releasing it as an ongoing product. Just think if Buffalo Trace released such a product it would probably be released as a high profile limited edition product in their E.H. Taylor line. 99 Rye is much like Chattanooga Whiskey’s other products that tweak the tried-and-true and yet refrain from coming on too strong. 99 Rye is unique tasting for a rye, but you can still recognize its rye heritage before focusing on what it's doing differently - making it a great place for people that feel adventurous, without wanting to take on too big of a risk.","As a small craft distillery with limited distribution, one could expect Chattanooga Whiskey to feature a higher-than-average price for their products. Whiskey drinkers have experienced this during the rise of craft distilleries over the last decade. Yet over the past year or so this trend has started to buckle. Many craft distilleries are becoming quite competitive with their pricing with many larger companies who often mass produce their whiskeys.

Chattanooga Whiskey is one such craft distillery that is being bullish with their pricing, with Chattanooga Whiskey 91 priced at $35, and Chattanooga Whiskey 111 Cask at $45. With Chattanooga Whiskey 99 Rye following suit at $40, there’a a little bit of “how are they doing that?” vibe. Sure their whiskey right now is only aged 2-3 years, but it also isn’t your run-of-the-mill craft whiskey either. In all three of their Tennessee High Malt products, they are malting, roasting, and/or toasting a number of grains to create their products. These extra processes require extra time, equipment, sourcing of grains, and expertise. And while none of this truly matters if you don’t like the end product, understanding the extra work involved inherently adds value. Even if this was just an above average tasting traditional rye whiskey, $40 is a decent value. Add in its unique taste and crafting techniques, 99 Rye is a great value and another easy buy recommendation for Chattanooga’s whiskeys.","With its more complex distilling process, Chattanooga Whiskey 99 Rye injects much more character into the traditional rye flavor profile.","Rye whiskeys have become stagnant thanks to years of tried-and-true products from major Kentucky distilleries. Thankfully there are a number of craft distilleries pushing the boundaries of rye and exploring what the grain can do. Too often rye releases lean too heavily on spice without ever exploring the nuances and the subtleties that the grain affords.

Chattanooga Whiskey 99 Rye isn't different simply for the sake of being different, but offers a unique spin on the traditional rye flavor profile that may buck your expectations of what a rye should taste like. It still features a lot of classic rye characteristics, but like many of Chattanooga Whiskey’s releases, they put their unique fingerprint on them. Unlike some of their more experimental releases, this doesn’t veer too far off into left field that it will only appeal to those who prefer oddball releases. Instead, this is more of a tweak to the classic rye flavor profile and one the rye whiskey as a spirit category desperately needed.

Yet I do see some room to improve. I hope with some additional aging, the flavors further develop and open up with the help of additional oak influence and maybe even a few more proof points. In its inaugural state, 99 Rye still satisfies and is quite exciting for rye drinkers. I like where Chattanooga Whiskey is going with all of their whiskeys, and especially as a fan of rye whiskey, I’m excited where their high malt distilling process is taking the spirit.",Eric,3,3.5,3,4,3.5,3,https://www.breakingbourbon.com/review/chattanooga-whiskey-99-rye
,Chicken Cock 160th Anniversary,Classification: Straight Bourbon,Company: Chicken Cock Whiskey,"Distillery: MGP Ingredients, Inc.",Released: July 2017,Proof: 90,Age: 8 Years,"Mashbill: 70% Corn, 21% Rye, 9% Malted Barley",Color: Light Copper,MSRP: $100,Official Website,"From the company’s website: “Originally established in 1856 in Paris, Kentucky, Chicken Cock quickly became one of the larger bourbon brands of the 19th century. Forced to move production to Canada when Prohibition started, Chicken Cock was smuggled across the border in tin cans, where it rose to fame as a popular serve at some of the era’s most famous speakeasies, including the legendary Cotton Club in Harlem. At the Cotton Club, when patrons ordered a “Chicken Cock,” waiters would present the tin can tableside and ceremoniously open it to reveal the bottle of Chicken Cock Whiskey inside. Duke Ellington writes about Chicken Cock in his memoirs, referring to the “brand that was served in a tin can.” At a rumored $15 per bottle Chicken Cock wasn’t for the light of pocket, but it was a small price to pay to secure a prime table near some of the greatest musicians of the era. After prohibition, multiple attempts were made to bring “the famous old brand” back to its former glory, but shifting drinking habits caused it, along with many significant American Whiskey brands of the 19th and early 20th centuries, to disappear..

For this limited release, 30 barrels will be released in total equating to approximately 7,200 bottles (an estimated 240 bottles per barrel). They will only be available to purchase online via the company’s website.

The bourbon in review is from barrel number 1, bottle number 10.","The aroma is basic, or common to say the least. Vanilla, caramel, a bit of oak, and a trace of ethanol comprise the nose. It’s a pleasant, inviting array of scents, but not at all distinguishing.","Light on entry, the bourbon allows you to hold it in your mouth for quite some time without experiencing an overwhelming burn. As evidenced by the nose, vanilla, oak, and caramel are present and mingle nicely together. While the mouthfeel does little to enhance the experience, it doesn’t detract from it either, delivering the flavors in a straightforward way. It’s an enjoyable flavor combination that’s impeccably balanced, albeit a little underwhelming.","Peppery spice kicks in, giving way to charred oak and intensely sweet caramel. It lingers for a while, with the spice coming back into play again after the caramel and charred oak taper off. There’s a trace of seasoned oak at the end, which enhances the experience as it draws to a close. Overall the finish is really well done, and easily the highlight of the sip.","With age statements dropping, it’s nice to see a new release with an age statement. That said, it’s a limited release, and age statements still remain fairly common in that realm. The bourbon’s other traits - mashbill, source, and flavor profile, aren’t particularly unusual in any way. Fortunately it’s released as a single barrel, so there will be some variation by barrel and hopefully some with flavor profiles that are a little more unique tasting than others.

While it has no impact on the whiskey itself, the history of the Chicken Cock brand is intriguing. The bottle design is also reminiscent of the old prescription whiskey bottle design, and it’s easily one of the best looking bottles I’ve ever seen. But these characteristics are only surface deep, and ultimately the bourbon inside tastes good, but leaves little lasting impression on its drinker.","Chicken Cock 160th Anniversary is an enjoyable bourbon. It’s a limited release. It’s a throwback to a storied brand. It has an 8 year age statement. It’s just not worth $100.

There’s no doubt the cost of sourcing bourbon has skyrocketed and the market is willing to pay a premium, but that doesn’t necessarily mean a bourbon’s price tag is in line with its value. While it’s released in a beautiful bottle and easily drinkable, it’s no better than many bourbons that can be found for less than $50 on the shelf today, some even less than $30. Being a limited release adds some prestige, and if the brand’s popularity is successfully revitalized with this reboot there’s no doubt this first edition will be worth its weight in gold. But that’s not how we rate our value section, and even though the whiskey inside the bottle is good, it’s not worth a Benjamin, plain and simple.",Chicken Cock 160th Anniversary is a slightly above average bourbon packaged in a beautiful bottle that inspires an exploration into the brand’s history.,"A part of me feels this review comes off too negative, and maybe it’s because of the price. $100 plus shipping is a lot, and I couldn’t take a sip of this without having that number pop into my head. It’s like trying to think about not scratching an itch...now all you can do is scratch it! The same thing was happening to me with this bourbon’s price tag. At such a premium, I was anticipating, and expecting, a lot more. It is an above average bourbon, but unfortunately the price casts a shadow on what’s inside the bottle.

Despite being a reboot, the storied brand inspired unexpected interest. I couldn’t help digging through Google searches reading everything I could find about the history of Chicken Cock...and maybe chuckling a little every time I thought about that name. My wife certainly wasn’t shy about laughing every time I went out of my way to announce that I was having a pour. But it really inspired exploration into the times of prohibition and the brand. History suddenly became interesting.

And then there’s that bottle. It really is a thing of beauty and now that it’s empty (we typically split our media sample bottles three ways) I feel almost compelled to do something with it and make it a centerpiece somewhere in my house. I think the whiskey will sell based on the bottle alone, but I really hope this review at least prepares buyers for a decent but not-so-memorable bourbon inside. While the bourbon is good, the juice just isn’t worth the squeeze. It just doesn’t have enough intrigue to justify the price. I really would have liked to see this at $50 a bottle, and I hope the next limited release offered by the brand is more in line with my price expectation.

,Corner Creek 10 Year Bourbon,Classification: Straight Bourbon,Company: Corner Creek Distillery Co.,Distillery: Sourced (from an undisclosed distillery[ies] in Kentucky),Release Date: July 2019,Proof: 88,Age: 10 Years,Mashbill: Undisclosed,Color: Light Gold,MSRP: $60 (2020),Official Website,"Corner Creek has quietly been around as a “modern” brand since the late 1980’s. During this time the brand has passed hands among various organizations, including Kentucky Bourbon Distillers (aka Willett), and currently being owned by Corner Creek Distillery Co. located in Crestwood, Kentucky. One thing has been consistent throughout the brand’s life, it has never been disclosed where the bourbon is sourced from. For the majority of the brand’s life, it has only sold as a no age statement (NAS) bourbon. This changed with the introduction of the non-chill filtered Corner Creek 10 Year.","The nose is surprisingly expressive for being less than 90 proof. Caramel, marshmallow, and barrel char waft out of the glass. A swirl of the glass reveals hints of cocoa, vanilla, sweet sugar gum drops, and white pepper spice. The combination of sweeter aromas mixed with the barrel char and hint of spice provides for a really delightful way to open up the sip, and one that continuously draws you back in for further exploration.","The palate is a tale of two flavor journeys. One takes you down a sweet path of brown sugar, burnt caramel, vanilla, and light cotton candy, while the other features a mingling of large doses of cigar box and aged oak. Again it’s surprising how this bourbon works its 88 proof to its advantage. While the earthier flavors slightly off balance things, it’s still an interesting flavor combination that works for the most part.","The finish is short and direct. Drier charred oak overpowers underlying tones of sweet vanilla and caramel. The light, sweeter flavors fade off, leaving just dried oak, leather, and a tad of tobacco leaf. It’s an adequate way to end the sip, but doesn’t shine as brightly as its counterparts.","Age stated\bourbon from an undisclosed distillery, isn’t breaking any new ground here. What seems to be less common nowadays though is bourbon sourced from Kentucky carrying a double digit age statement . Additionally, what makes Corner Creek stand out is the fact that it delivers a surprisingly deep amount of flavors for being such a low-proof bourbon.

Often when I taste bourbons under 90 proof, I find myself asking for just a bit more from it. I usually point towards the low proof, but this could be due to the fact that I tend to gravitate towards higher-proof, fuller-flavored bourbons. However, I feel it’s mainly the fact that it’s just really hard to be under 90 proof and compete flavorwise with a majority of bourbons on the market. Surprisingly, Corner Creek 10 Year is able to. It delivers a flavorful sip, that while not necessarily mind blowing, is one that will make you appreciative of what is capable out of a well-aged bourbon no matter the proof.","Corner Creek 10 Year may deliver a decent sip for it’s proof point, but it comes at a price that will make most anyone pause. Up front it needs to be said that there are a multitude of bourbons that can be found for less that deliver an equal or much better sip. Add in the fact that Corner Creek 10 Year is coming in at below 90 proof, and even with a 10 year age statement, $60 for a sourced bourbon with these characteristics seems like a hard sell.  

However a more apt comparison would be Basil Hayden 10 Year release. This was another 10 year old Kentucky bourbon that was below 90 proof. Here though Basil Hayden’s 10 Year’s flavor profile was flat and forgettable. Corner Creek’s 10 Year’s flavorful sip is the one redeeming area that doesn’t make Corner Creek 10 Year a bad value. That’s not an ringing endorsement of a great price, instead it’s more so an acknowledgement that at the sip within makes the price tag hurt a little less. When adding onto the fact that there aren’t too many double digit age stated bourbons on the market for those who prefer a lower proof, and the value for Corner Creek 10 Year doesn’t seem so bad after all.","Its low proof and boring bottle label might turn many off to it, but Corner Creek 10 Year surprises with a weighty 10 age statement and a flavorful blend of sweet and earthy flavors.","Corner Creek 10 Year bourbon seems like it should be a straightforward bourbon to rate: non-distiller produced, from an unnamed Kentucky distillery, with a low proof and a high price point. Yet, the old adage of don’t judge a book by its cover never held more true than when it comes to Corner Creek 10 Year.

While it starts stronger than it finishes, what buoys Corner Creek 10 Year is the fact that it delivers an above-average sip. Its well-rounded flavor profile is full of sweet flavors that play well with aged oak characteristics thanks to the 10 years it has spent in the barrel. Additionally, its lower proof actually works well here as it makes it more accessible to bourbon drinkers who may not be seeking a higher proof pour.

If you normally prefer lower proof bourbons such as Basil Hayden’s or Four Roses Bourbon, Corner Creek 10 Year is a good bottle to target. For those that prefer a high proof burner, this won’t be a bourbon you reach for all that frequently. However, most everyone should be able to appreciate the fact that Corner Creek 10 Year is able to extract a surprisingly flavorful sip for what normally might be a very forgettable bottle on paper.",Jordan,3.5,3,2.5,3,2.5,3,https://www.breakingbourbon.com/review/corner-creek-10-year-bourbon

This helped draw a lot of attention to the company’s unique products which have totaled near 30 in the company’s short lifespan. In early 2020, Corsair launched a rebrand of their product line focusing on four main products with a modern redesign of their trademark ska/Reservoir Dogs inspired logo. Triple Smoke American Single Malt Whiskey is Corsair's most well known whiskey and according to them, helped put the company on the map. Bottle in review is from Batch No. 324, Bottle No. 38.","With an upfront blast of smoky malt, the aroma isn’t your typical American single malt. Within the smokiness lies interweaving notes of cherry, orange, mint, and a touch of peat. It’s nicely layered and features a manageable intensity that lets you enjoy it without being overwhelmed by its smoky component.","A thin mouthfeel is immediately noticeable before being broadsided by a wall of smoke. This whiskey isn’t shy about smokiness, as its intensity is forceful at times. As the smoke ebbs and flows, layers of cherry, pine, and mild peat become more evident and add welcomed complexity.","Light youthful graininess pulls out from the smoke during the start of the finish that adds a needed contrast. With it, the whiskey’s malt side becomes palatable and pairs nicely with the smoke. Its long aftertaste is overrun by a drawn out veil of smoke that flirts with overstaying its welcome","A smoky flavor profile is common in many scotches, but most American whiskey companies steer clear of it. Some of this might be due to tradition or possibly because a smoky flavor note can be very polarizing, resulting in a love it or hate it attitude. The larger reason is whiskey drinkers who mainly drink bourbon, rye, or American whiskey typically don’t have much exposure to it and therefore may find it too foreign or exotic for their tastes.

Corsair, along with Balcones, was one of the first noteworthy craft distillers that leaned hard into featuring smoke in their whiskeys. Founded in 2008, Corsair made their mark in the burgeoning new craft distillery scene by doing what bourbon and American whiskey makers weren’t, experimenting with unusual flavor profiles.

Corsair’s Triple Smoke encapsulated just that and helped put smoke-fueled whiskeys on American drinkers’ radar. By individually smoking three different malts it gives the whiskey a complex character underneath all of its smoke-filled sip. Smoke has become more commonplace among distillers since Triple Smoke’s debut, (Woodford Reserve even released one in 2017), but few reach the intensity or brand awareness and following of Corsair's flagship release. Even to this day, there are very few American whiskeys that can directly compare to what Triple Smoke brings to its sip.","Taking the road less traveled can often come at a cost. It’s filled with unknowns and this often demands additional time and money. These risk-taking endeavors can quickly sink a new distillery. They don’t have the deep pockets big distilleries do, but that also allows them to take chances and sniff out new niches in the market.

When Triple Smoke was first released in the early 2010s, there wasn’t anything on the market like it, and to a degree, that is still true today. Because of its heavy smoke component, there is always going to be a segment of drinkers that steer clear of it. All of this usually will add to the price of a product targeting a micro audience. Surprisingly, the price of Triple Smoke hasn’t changed much since its inception. Granted, $50 was a harder sell years ago for this type of product from an unproven distillery, but that isn’t the case now. Corsair is well established and has a reputation for pushing boundaries. A price of $50 lands this whiskey in a sweet spot, and is exactly what someone should expect to pay and for a whiskey this unique.","Not surprisingly, smoke is the name of the game, yet Triple Smoke offers complexity despite its youthfulness, and is quite a bit of fun for those who feel adventurous.","When I first tasted Triple Smoke in 2013, it wasn’t for me. Smoke wasn’t a flavor note I particular cared for at the time and felt it was much too overpowering for its own good. Over the years though I developed a curiosity and taste for unconventional whiskeys. It’s easy to view Triple Smoke and other offbeat products existing simply for the sake of being different. In reality we need more rabble-rousers like Corsair taking chances and creating unique products that push American whiskey in new exciting directions.


Triple Smoke probably won’t be an everyday drinker for most people, but a fun one to visit from time to time and stand out as a one-of-a-kind bottle in their collection. Is the smoke overpowering? Absolutely, but with the name Triple Smoke that is to be expected. Being aged for only 7 months will be a sticking point for some and certainly won’t impress anyone. This probably has more to do with controlling the intensity of the smoke component than an unwillingness to age it longer. This also likely contributes to its thin mouthfeel and slight graininess, but on the flip side, this helps provide contrast against its heavier smoky notes. I’m curious if Corsair could somehow combat this and make it a thicker and richer whiskey without adding any more smoke - either via higher proof or blending with a non-smoked malt. As is, Triple Smoke is a provocative sipper that will challenge you and most likely take you out of your comfort zone.",Eric,3,3,2.5,4.5,2.5,3,https://www.breakingbourbon.com/review/corsair-triple-smoke
,E.H. Taylor Jr. Amaranth Grain of the Gods,Classification: Straight Bourbon,"Company: Sazerac Company, Inc.",Distillery: Buffalo Trace,Release Date: July 2019,Proof: 100,Age: NAS (Over 10 years per the company press release),"Mashbill: Undisclosed (Buffalo Trace Mashbill #1 that replaces rye with amaranth as the flavoring grain - corn, amaranth, and malted barley)",Color: Light Copper,Price: $70 (2019),Official Website,"Amaranth “Grain of the Gods” is the tenth release in the E.H. Taylor, Jr. lineup. The standard lineup includes Small Batch Bourbon, Single Barrel Bourbon, Barrel Proof Bourbon, and Straight Rye. According to the company Press Release, Amaranth was aged over 10 years and will be a one-time only release that will start hitting markets in late July.

Like most E.H. Taylor releases, Amaranth Bourbon is Bottled-in-Bond. To be labelled Bottled-in-Bond, the whiskey must be the product of one distillation season and one distiller at a single distillery, aged in a federally bonded warehouse under U.S. government supervision for at least four years, and it must be bottled at exactly 100 proof. Additionally, the Bottled-in-Bond label must clearly identify the distillery where it was distilled and where it was bottled, if different.","Caramel, butterscotch, baking spices, and seasoned oak come together in a rich, fragrant presentation. The overall aroma was borderline incredible with the first pour, but seemed to taper off in its intensity with subsequent pours on the following days. Nevertheless, ethanol is kept in check and the aroma remained complex, inviting, and most notably, interesting with a unique quality I just can’t quite put my finger on.","Its thin mouthfeel is immediately noticeable, but this is countered with a vibrant set of flavors. Butterscotch, honey, caramel, summer fruits, and again a touch of oak. It’s a noticeable step down from the intensity of the aroma, but still enjoyable.","Sweet flavors tease at first, but traces of leather and tobacco quickly develop as well. Some bitterness follows along with a tannic note. It’s medium-length at best, and feels somewhat abbreviated and subpar compared to the rest of the sip.","Buffalo Trace has many experiments in the works, and in recent years has chosen to honor E.H. Taylor by releasing limited experimental variations of the brand. Attributing this to Taylor’s persona, Buffalo Trace has stated it “honors Taylor’s enduring spirit of innovation and commitment to exceptional whiskey.”

The tenth unique release in the Taylor lineup, Amaranth is the sixth special release and the second to use a unique mashbill. However, while Four Grain had four grains in the mashbill, they still remained the most commonly used grains - corn, rye, wheat, and malted barley. Amaranth is the first of its kind, with no other previous bourbon using the grain in its mashbill. This is surprising considering distilleries like Corsair have released Grainiac (9 grain mashbill) and Insane in the Grain (12 grain mashbill) whiskeys - none of which used amaranth. That being said, Buffalo Trace Mashbill #1 is believed to be 10% rye or less, and since this bourbon used the #1 mashbill with amaranth in place of rye, the percentage of amaranth grain is still relatively small.

Amaranth grain is most likened to wheat, and was once a staple of the Aztecs, used in numerous food items. They also used the grain to form images of their gods during the sacred month of Huitzilopochitli, and then at the end of the month ate them in order to take in the gods, which explains the origins of this bourbon's name. Currently, amaranth is popular in gluten free cooking.  

Whether it’s the amaranth grain or other contributing factors, the resulting whiskey’s flavor profile deviates from the norm. It presents like a wheated bourbon, but there is a quality I just can’t quite pinpoint. It’s most prominent in the nose, and as a result the most interesting part of this whiskey.","It might be hard for those reading this to believe, but at one time the full four-bottle standard E.H. Taylor, Jr. lineup was regularly available, even Barrel Proof if you looked hard enough. Sitting amongst the other bottles, both its packaging - tall nicely labelled bottles in tubes - and price felt premium. I considered it a pioneer into regularly available premium bourbon and American whiskey, a category that had hardly been defined at that point in time. Soon after, limited E.H. Taylor releases gained momentum, and before long any limited release under the brand has been met with a rabid fanbase.

Like most other limited released they’ve done, Buffalo Trace has kept the MSRP of Amaranth relatively low, in this case $70. But with the three tier system in play and demand at unprecedented levels, the true cost for a retailer to have a bottle (or a few) of Amaranth in stock may be much higher realistically speaking. Additionally, since the time I considered E.H. Taylor a premium brand pioneer, retailers have grown more savvy. Most see it coming and many know it will likely command a premium in the secondary market, making markup hard to pass up. As a result, unless release numbers are excessive, few bottles will actually see store shelves, and if they do, many won’t be priced at MSRP. To that end, $70 for a one-time one-of-a-kind 10+ year old limited release from a strong brand is an easy buy for this whiskey, and if I see any at or around that price you can bet I’ll be buying as many as I can find.

However, the bourbon inside the bottle cannot be ignored, and it’s at best a fair price point when its limited status is stripped from the equation. Next to E.H. Taylor Single Barrel, Amaranth’s nose is better and it is more unique overall, but it’s not necessarily a much better bourbon.  ","The first of its kind, Amaranth is a unique exploration in an alternative grain that succeeds in being different enough to capture fans’ interest.","I was prepared to be disappointed with Amaranth, but I wasn’t. More often than not I’ve found unique mashbills surprisingly boring, in what seems like an interesting idea results in so many flavors that everything just becomes muddled. Others have just been letdowns. In this case, the relatively small amount of amaranth grain in the mashbill seems to have produced enough variation from the norm to capture my interest.

Unfortunately, the fact of the matter is, how this bourbon tastes probably doesn’t matter when it comes to the insane prices people will likely pay for this. The fever will drive demand through the roof. We don’t know how many bottles will be released, but I would bet many won’t actually see the shelves, so regardless of the actual release number it won’t feel like very many are out there. However, if I can stress anything it would be that this is an interesting one-off release, but it really ends there. Don’t pay a silly price for it. Pick up one, or a few, at or around MSRP if you’re lucky enough to find any. Then pop the cork. The true value in these experimental releases is actually tasting the resulting whiskey, and I can bet Edmund Taylor would have wanted it that way.

,E.H. Taylor Small Batch,Classification: Straight Bourbon,Company: Sazerac Company Inc.,Distillery: Buffalo Trace,Released: Ongoing,Proof: 100,Age: NAS,Mashbill: Undisclosed,Color:  Light Copper,MSRP: $40 (2016),Official Website,"This is the introductory bourbon in the E.H. Taylor whiskey lineup which also includes ongoing releases of a Single Barrel, Barrel Proof, and Rye variant throughout the year, along with limited one-off releases. With exception of their Barrel Proof bourbon, all E.H. Taylor whiskeys are Bottled in Bond (BiB). To be labelled BiB, the whiskey must be the product of one distillation season and one distiller at a single distillery, aged in a federally bonded warehouse under U.S. government supervision for at least four years, and it must be bottled at exactly 100 proof. Additionally, the BiB label must clearly identify the distillery where it was distilled and where it was bottled, if different.","Some bourbons hide their proof and others seem to try to live larger than what they actually are. E.H. Taylor Small Batch is one of those. Lifting the glass up to my nose I’m greeted with butterscotch, caramel, warmed baked multigrain bread, and hints of liquorice and dried raisins, all of which are undermined by a heavy hanging dose of alcohol. This was surprising to me, as while you sometimes have a little alcohol scent upfront when you get to the 100 proof range, this comes across as excessive. After a few minutes in the glass however, the alcohol scent mostly dissipates and you’re left with a pleasant blend of all of the aforementioned scents.","Plump dried raisins, lightly charred oak, and vanilla are all front and center in this classic palate with a twist. The mouthfeel is nicely balanced and more floral than I expected based on the nose. Overall fantastic in terms of being not too heavy, not too light, just the perfect balance that allows you to hold it in your mouth and really chew on it. It’s not overly complex, but that doesn’t make it any less enjoyable.","Vanilla, light tobacco, leather, and white pepper start the finish off, along with a pleasant burn that’s isolated to my mouth only. As the finish goes on and flavors dissipate, a dry leathery flavor dusted with a slight hint of white pepper and dried apricot remains. Like the palate, it’s not overly complex, yet it’s still enjoyable. However I do wish it lasted a little longer than it does, as it completely disappears after a minute or two.","At 100 proof, it’s very easy to drink and the flavors are rich and quite enjoyable. For an everyday small batch bourbon, E.H. Taylor’s release is in-line with the rest of the pack. It delivers a quality well balanced flavor profile that is hard to overly critique, yet is also hard pressed to really distinguish itself from say a Buffalo Trace or Four Roses Small Batch. While I was surprised at how alcohol forward it was on the nose, given time to open up, it quickly resolves itself in the glass thankfully.

What really wins it over for me though, is that while it’s a small batch variant, it nicely captures many of the same traits that are exhibited in the more expensive E.H. Taylor Single Barrel and is able to do so for $20 less. I’m not saying its flavor profile is better than the single barrel version, or that the single barrel version is phenomenal, but when a small batch can almost match a single barrel product of itself, that’s pretty impressive. While not the exact carbon copy flavor wise, it comes satisfyingly close.","While in-line with some of its peers mentioned above, it’s slightly out of line on price. At $40 this is selling for around $10 more than it should be for what’s in the bottle. It’s not horribly overpriced, but it is overpriced nonetheless, especially compared to other bottles retailing for $40 such as Maker's 46 or Knob Creek Single Barrel. That being said, Buffalo Trace seems to be pricing this specifically at this price point for a reason. The company has aligned the E.H. Taylor brand as a standalone premium line. It allows the company to differentiate itself from their other products, and in this case gives the impression that the E.H. Taylor Small Batch is a more premium product over their standard Buffalo Trace.

In order to make up for the price however Buffalo Trace makes up for it in the packaging, as the E.H. Taylor brand really shines when it comes to their packaging. From the “faux” tax strip on their bottles (albeit in orange and not the traditional green for BiB whiskeys), the copious amount of information they list on the bottle, and the tube it comes in, a high amount of detail was put into the packaging for this bourbon. It truly makes for a great bourbon to gift to someone. While this shouldn’t be a justification for being priced higher than it deserves, it’s more than many brands currently do to make up for it.","Although slightly overpriced, E.H. Taylor Small Batch backs up it’s fancy packaging with a solid bourbon game.","E.H. Taylor Small Batch is really a contrasting bourbon. On one hand you have a really full-flavored bourbon that can almost go head to head with it’s bigger brother E.H. Taylor Single Barrel and holds it’s own. On the other hand you're paying slightly more for the presentation of the packaging for the bourbon it contains. While I wish this sold for about $10 less, there’s no denying that it’s a really solid bourbon that most individuals will enjoy. The palate is delectable and sans the heavy alcohol upfront, the overall flavor profile is enjoyable. If you haven’t had a chance to experience this yet make sure to seek it out, as it truly is a good introduction into the E.H. Taylor line of whiskeys.",Jordan,2.5,3.5,3,2.5,2.5,3,https://www.breakingbourbon.com/review/e-h-taylor-small-batch
,Eagle Rare 10 Year Single Barrel,Classification: Straight Bourbon,Company: Sazerac Company Inc.,Distillery: Buffalo Trace,Released: Ongoing,Proof: 90,Age: 10 Years,Mashbill: Undisclosed (Buffalo Trace Mashbill #1),Color:  Deep Gold,MSRP: $29 (2016),Official Website,"Eagle Rare uses the #1 Mashbill from Buffalo Trace, which is thought to be a low rye mash bill consisting of 10% or less rye. Eagle Rare recently went through a label design change which moved the 10 year age statement from the bottleneck to the back of the bottle. They also removed the single barrel statement from the bottle altogether. Buffalo Trace stated that because of the move from a hand-bottling line to a high speed automated line, they can no longer use the single barrel statement. This is due to the fact that a bottle could technically contain a bourbon from two different barrels when the line switches from one barrel to the next.","Eagle Rare 10 Year Single Barrel has a subtle yet delicious nose. Upfront I am hit with strong scents of orange peels and citrus mixed with aged oak. Lingering on the nose longer, I pick up scents of toasted marshmallow drizzled with honey. It’s not the most complex nose, but it’s a really easy nose to pick apart. It's a great choice for someone who has a harder time picking out different scents on the nose because they're prominent and easily distinguished with this one.","The palate is simplistically sweet without a ton of depth. Upfront notes of honey, toasted brown sugar, new oak, and light traces of white pepper are all present. While not deep, it’s very tasty and I would imagine that even a non-bourbon drinker would find it enjoyable. I found myself going back often to sip this throughout the review to taste more of the deliciously sweet palate.","The finish continues the trend of sweetness that is found in the nose and palate. Medium in length, the most predominate notes are bubble gum, toffee, and honey. Light traces of vanilla and dry leather round out the finish. After the delicious palate, I had high expectations for a deeper finish, but that wasn’t the case. While not bad per se, it’s also nothing memorable either.","The market for aged single barrels is slowly shrinking and Eagle Rare presents a great opportunity to dive into the single barrel world without spending a lot of money. That being said, the flavor profile it presents isn’t super unique. Sweet and subtle, it reminded me of Four Roses Small Batch and E.H. Taylor Small Batch, among other sweeter bourbons on the market. It’s unique in the sense that it’s one of the few mass produced single barrels on the market, but that’s about the only unique trait this bourbon has going for it. Furthermore, at any time Buffalo Trace could decide to move this to a small batch brand since the single barrel language has been removed from the new bottles being produced.","Buffalo Trace offers a great range of single barrels all for under $60 with Eagle Rare being the least expensive. While many were dismayed due to the recent removal of the single barrel wording from the label, don’t let this deter you. For about $30 or less, you’re receiving a 10 year old single barrel that can be enjoyed by almost anyone. While you can pick up a bottle of Elmer T. Lee single barrel for a few dollars more, you have to realize that Buffalo Trace now has this bourbon on a limited release schedule. For the price and the fact that you can pick this up any day of the year, this should be a staple in every bourbon lover’s bar, as it represents a phenomenal value for a bourbon that can be appreciated by all.","Delicious, inexpensive, and readily available...bird's definitely the word on Eagle Rare 10 Year Single Barrel.","Let’s get one thing out of the way, if you’re looking for a “baby” Eagle Rare 17, you won’t find it here. Instead of the dryness and oakiness found in Eagle Rare 17 Year-Old from the Buffalo Trace Antique collection, Eagle Rare Single Barrel presents you with a sweet and mellow bourbon. This shouldn’t come as much of a surprise seeing as how you're comparing a 10 year old $29 bourbon with a 17+ year old $80 bourbon.

What you do receive with Eagle Rare 10 Year Single Barrel is a bourbon that’s an all-around great value for the price being charged, and one that you can’t go wrong with. While you won’t be blown away, you won’t be disappointed either. This is definitely a bottle I’d recommend any bourbon lover keep in their home bar.",Jordan,3,3.5,2.5,2.5,4.5,3,https://www.breakingbourbon.com/review/eagle-rare-10-year-single-barrel
,Early Times Bottled in Bond Bourbon,Classification: Straight Bourbon,Company: Early Times Distillery Co.,Distillery: Brown-Forman Distillery,Release Date: Ongoing,Proof: 100,Age: 4 Years,"Mashbill: 79% Corn, 11% Rye, 10% Malted Barley",Color: Dark Copper,Price: $25 - 1L Bottles Only - 750ml Not Offered (2020),Official Website,"Early Times was created by John Henry “Jack” Beam, son of David Beam, Jim Beam’s brother. Jack left his father’s distillery in 1860 at the age of 21. He built his own distillery near Bardstown, Kentucky and started distilling Early Times there. Jack later passed away in 1915 at the age of 75 and upon his passing the distillery ceased operations.

The Early Times brand and stock of aging barrels (though notably not the distillery), were eventually acquired by Owsley Brown, owner of Brown-Forman, in 1923. In 1945, Brown-Forman launched Early Times Bottled in Bond which sold so well it eventually became the most popular bourbon in America in 1953. When Brown-Forman constructed a new distillery located in Shively, Kentucky in 1955, the distillery was originally named after Early Times before it became Brown-Forman Distillery.

Unfortunately, during the difficult times endured by the industry in the 1970s and 1980s, the Early Times brand changed from bourbon to blended whiskey, leaving the Bottled in Bond label behind. Early Times “Old Style Kentucky Whisky” was born, which was a blend of straight bourbon and light whiskey.

According to the company website, DSP No. 354, where Early Times is made, is the longest continually operating distillery under the same ownership in Kentucky. The Early Times brand itself is one of the longest running labels in bourbon, now celebrating 160 years according to the company press release.

Early Times Bottled in Bond was re-released as a limited edition in July 2017 to limited markets. Since then, distribution has expanded to include additional markets across the United States which currently includes Arizona, Colorado, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Kansas, Kentucky, Michigan, North Carolina, Ohio, Oregon, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, and Washington. Distribution is slowly expanding to the rest of the United States.

To be labelled Bottled in Bond, the whiskey must be the product of one distillation season and one distiller at a single distillery, aged in a federally bonded warehouse under U.S. government supervision for at least four years, and it must be bottled at exactly 100 proof. Additionally, the Bottled-in-Bond label must clearly identify the distillery where it was distilled and where it was bottled, if different.‍","Subtle hints of honey and orange peel fade into a caramel backdrop. While the nose is characteristically sweet and approachable, it’s quite light overall, requiring a swirl of the glass and hard pull to dissect even these most prominent scents.","Sweet caramel and candy corn coat the mouth, enveloping the tongue with a creamy, rich texture. Citrus and vanilla mingle in, along with a very subtle tobacco note. A light rye spice teases as you swirl the bourbon around coating the inside of your mouth. It’s pleasant and arguably impossible to dislike, but doesn’t quite have enough oomph to elevate the bourbon to greater heights.","The spice picks up in the finish, with a peppery-rye pop that’s followed by a developing sweetness comprised of vanilla and raw sugar. The spicy-sweet mix finds a nice balance, making for an enjoyable and long lasting finish. The finish is the highlight of the sip, pulling what is otherwise a pleasant but average experience well into above average territory.","The Early Times brand has been owned by Brown-Forman since it was purchased in 1923. While it’s born from the same distillery as many of Brown-Forman's brands, the Early Times bourbon mashbill is slightly different than the more common 72% corn, 18% rye, and 10% malted barley mashbill used to make bourbons that comprise the Woodford Reserve and Old Forester lineups.

Because it's bottled in bond, this variation of Early Times can be compared to other bottled in bond bourbons that are likely at or near the minimum 4 years old required by law. One in particular that comes to mind is Old Grand-Dad Bottled in Bond, a fan favorite with a long running history as well. By comparison, Early Times Bottled in Bond is more mellow, offering a softer and more subtle flavor profile than the spicier more cinnamon-heavy flavor offered by Old Grand-Dad.

In characterizing Early Times Bottled in Bond's flavor profile in a general sense, the observation that it comes across as mellow holds true against other brands as well. Understanding what makes Early Times' flavor profile a bit different leads back to its production process. In addition to a unique mashbill, Early Times is also crafted with a proprietary yeast strain. Notably, when the brand first started in 1860, Jack Beam made it by cooking the mash in small tubs and then boiling the distiller's beer in a copper pot still over open flames. Tasting an older bottle of Early Times (pictured in the gallery below), it is surprising how creamy and unusual the mouthfeel is. This characteristic remains, though less so, in the current Bottled in Bond variation.","An important fact to note is Early Times Bottled in Bond is only released in 1 liter bottles, a full ⅓ more bourbon than what is found in the more standard 750ml packaging. Normalizing the $25 price tag for a liter to the more standard 750ml equates to a price of only $18.75 per 750ml worth of bourbon. Put simply, this is a fantastic deal. As we see distribution expand to different parts of the country and distributors and states set their baseline, pricing of course will vary from market to market. However, because this is a drinker’s bourbon in every sense of the word, I’d argue the value would quickly fall off as the markup increases. Entering into just a slightly higher $30 price range reveals plenty of options that offer up a more interesting sipping experience, making Early Times' flavor profile a bit less exciting by comparison.",Early Times Bottled in Bond is a revitalized historic brand extension that offers an easy-to-like drinker's bourbon at an even easier-to-like price.,"Early Times Bottled in Bond succeeds at what it sets out to do - appeal to many at a fantastic price point. The brand brings with it a long and storied history, an added bonus for anyone who thinks beyond the glass. However, while the flavor profile and overall drinking experience is enjoyable, it is really the combination of a great price and approachable flavor profile that make this worthwhile. Given the fact that we’ve seen great value bourbons become overhyped and subsequently overpriced - due to either the producer increasing MSRP or retailers’ perception of high demand - it is important to note that Early Times Bottled in Bond will ultimately lose its magic should that occur. Put simply, Early Times Bottled in Bond is absolutely worth seeking out and having as a regular on your shelf, just not if you have to overpay for it.",Nick,2.5,2.5,3,3,4,3,https://www.breakingbourbon.com/review/early-times-bottled-in-bond-bourbon

Light on complexity but pleasant in flavor.,Dry finish with a hearty amount of oak. Medium length finish with spice that hangs in there until the end.,"The main trait this bourbon has going for it is its age. The above average length  this bourbon spent in the barrel probably turned what would have been a forgettable bourbon into something more noteworthy.

It's a great deal. It’s worth noting that I would have gladly paid more for a more complex palate, and apparently Heaven Hill knows people want this: $20 more nets you a barrel proof version of this bourbon. They also make more complex versions of this in a 20 & 21 year editions that will cost you $150. Apparently that’s the rub here. Complexity is going to cost you a lot.","An even and balanced bourbon that while not complex, still provides enough traits to keep it interesting.",This is a classic example of a well rounded bourbon with few gimmicks. It benefited a lot from its age. Tasty amounts of oak flavor are what stand out most.

He is credited with being the first to put his distillate into charred oak barrels, one of the key requirements for a whiskey to be classified as bourbon.

First brought to market in 1986, the long-running Elijah Craig Small Batch Bourbon provides the base for Toasted Barrel Finish. According to the company Press Release, “The process begins with fully matured Small Batch, which is dumped and then re-entered at barrel proof into a second, custom toasted new oak barrel designed in partnership with Independent Stave Company. Made with 18-month air dried oak, the finishing barrel is first toasted and then flash-charred using a moderate toast temperature and toast time. An extensive research and development process resulted in a final barrel toast profile bringing forward dark sugar flavors within the wood to create a balance of smokiness and sweetness after months of finishing.”

Elijah Craig Toasted Barrel Finish will be a permanent line extension for the brand, and is slated to launch nationally on an allocated basis in September 2020.","Toasted marshmallows, rich caramel, vanilla, and baking spices make for a sweet and inviting nose. Light undertones of oak, summer fruits, and Granny Smith apples are also present, but need to be teased out with a swirl of the glass and deep inhale. The apple note hints towards a presence of acetaldehyde, however if it is present, it's a welcome amount that serves to add more dimension than anything else. Rich and appealing overall.","Sweeter flavors of graham cracker, chocolate, and caramel contrast nutmeg and pepper spice notes. A touch of seasoned wood is evident, but fleeting. The presentation of flavors is characteristically sweet, and quite enjoyable.","A blast of rye spice is followed by a rich caramel, brown sugar sweetness. Fireball candy heat along with hints of tobacco and oak lightly tease as the flavors taper off. The finish is slightly dry and tannic, more so than is found with the standard Small Batch. While a slight blemish to the experience, it’s still an acceptable finish overall.","The toasted barrel finishing process succeeds in creating a totally different product than Elijah Craig's standard Small Batch Bourbon. The result is a sweeter, spicier, less oaky, and slightly more complex bourbon that provides a uniquely different flavor profile and drinking experience. Regardless of an individual’s preference for one flavor profile versus the other, the fact that the toasted oak finishing changes the base bourbon cannot be debated.

In the world of bourbon, finishing in a new secondary barrel with a toasted finish is actually not so common. Michter’s Toasted Barrel Finish is the closest and most notable comparison, and then reaching a bit you find Woodford Reserve Double Oaked and Old Forester 1910 (both of which are finished in a secondary toasted barrel that is also charred).

While they are all a bit sweet with evidence of chocolate notes, Elijah Craig’s finishing process results in a sweeter, spicier, and admittedly more tannic end product than Michter’s and the Brown-Forman products. Importantly, this finishing process maintains the “straight bourbon” class and type designation, as new charred barrels are used for both the original aging and secondary finishing process (though they are so lightly charred they are referred to as “toasted”).","While the standard Elijah Craig Small Batch has maintained a sub-$30 price tag, it is not surprising to see a line extension that requires a second round of aging in additional new barrels at nearly double the price. This is consistent with Heaven Hill’s re-release of Heaven Hill 7 Year Bottled in Bond at a much higher price ($40 versus $12) as compared to its 6 year old predecessor. Notably, Woodford Reserve Double Oaked ($45), Michter’s Toasted Barrel Finish ($50), and Old Forester 1910 ($55) are similarly priced.

With Small Batch Elijah Craig typically having an age of 9 years or more, adding secondary aging in a new toasted oak barrel is no small feat. Moreover, this not-so-common technique adds a layer of dimension to the base bourbon. So while $50 is certainly premium price territory, it’s in line with other major brands that have gone through the additional work required to rebarrel a bourbon in a second new barrel.","Elijah Craig Toasted Barrel Finish is a sweet, unique tasting bourbon that results from a not-so-common finishing process.","Heaven Hill continues to expand their Elijah Craig bourbon line, this time with a unique yet straightforward finishing process. While some may prefer the more oak-forward flavor profile of the standard Elijah Craig Small Batch, no one can argue with the fact that the toasted barrel finish truly changes the flavor profile of the base bourbon. I found myself enjoying the shift towards sweeter notes, preferring it to the standard Small Batch by comparison. Uncorking a new retired bottle of age stated Elijah Craig 12 Year reminded me of how oak-forward Small Batch’s predecessor was, with the new no-age statement Small Batch shifting away from oak in favor of more common caramel and vanilla notes. While it won’t be for everyone, Toasted Barrel Finish brings some much-needed character to the brand, character that is evident in Elijah Craig Barrel Proof, some single barrel Elijah Craig single barrel picks, and older age-stated Elijah Craig releases like their 18 Year. At $50, it’s a splurge, but well worth it for bourbon enthusiasts seeking a bourbon with some additional character.",Nick,3,3.5,2.5,4,2.5,3,https://www.breakingbourbon.com/review/elijah-craig-toasted-barrel-finish-straight-bourbon
,Evan Williams 23 Years Old,Classification: Straight Bourbon,Company: Heaven Hill,Distillery: Old Evan Williams Distillery,Release Date: Ongoing,Proof: 107,Age: 23 Years,"Mashbill: 78% Corn, 12% Malted Barley, and 10% Rye",Color: Dark Copper,MSRP: $350 (2019),Official Website,"Evan Williams 23 Year Old Bourbon is currently only being sold as a gift shop exclusive at the Evan Williams Experience in downtown Louisville, KY. This expression is the cousin of Elijah Craig 23 Year Old, as both come from the Heaven Hill Distillery, both are aged for 23 years, and both share the same mashbill. This particular bottle is considered “pre-fire” Heaven Hill as it was distilled and barreled before the epic fire that took place on November 7, 1996.","Heavy aged oak is immediately noticeable but by no means overpowering. Digging deeper reveals classic scents such as vanilla and caramel, along with scents of marshmallow, creme brulee, and syrup. The nose is surprisingly rich and for such an old bourbon bringing forth a nice mixture of sweet along with oak. Interestingly enough, there is only the faintest hint of ethanol.","The sip starts with a bit of tannic wood which is immediately joined with sweeter flavors. The result is a big hit of sweet vanilla along with hard cherry candy, honey, seasoned oak, cigar box, and black pepper. The higher proof shows through and adds a little bit of fiery heat to the sip. A medium bodied mouthfeel delivers a surprisingly sweeter and more flavorful sip than expected for a 23 year old bourbon.","Unlike the nose and palate, the finish shows just how long this bourbon has spent in the barrel. Father time is evident as the sweetness found earlier is replaced by drier notes. The fiery heat carriers over from the palate and is joined by wood, pepper, and light cherry Halls. The heat lingers with traces of dry leather and tannic wood, making for a longer than necessary finish, and one that doesn’t quite live up to what the nose & palate delivers.","Evan Williams 23 Year is an oddball in the Evan Williams family line. The next oldest Evan Williams is 12 years version that is only available in the gift shop and overseas, while the current standard available expressions all fall below 10 years of age. To see an expression aged so far from its siblings is unique in and of itself, however being aged to 23 years is where things start to get interesting.  

There aren't many ongoing releases of 23 year old bourbons out there. In fact there are only three in total, the other two being Pappy Van Winkle 23 Year and Elijah Craig 23 Year. Because bourbon is aged in charred new oak barrels, it’s not meant to be aged for a long time compared to what you might find in a scotch or other whiskeys that utilize pre-used barrels for the aging process. Bourbon aged over 20 years just doesn’t deliver a lot of flavor outside of oak. Additionally, once you get to this age, there just isn’t much bourbon left in the barrel to bottle, and sometimes barrels are completely empty by this point.

In tasting Evan Williams 23 Year next to Pappy Van Winkle 23 Year, I found both to have their own traits to appreciate, with Evan Williams delivering heavier notes. However compared to its sibling from the same distillery, I found Evan Williams 23 Year brought about a much more flavorful sip between the two. In both cases I credit this to Evan Williams’ higher proof content. Being bottled at 107 proof makes Evan Williams 23 Year the only 23 year old over 100 proof, which in this case correlates to a more nuanced and flavorful sip.","No matter how you try to justify it, $350 is a lot of money for a bourbon regardless of the age. In Evan Williams case, it happens to be priced well above the MSRP for Elijah Craig 23 Year and even Pappy Van Winkle 23 Year, both of which manage to stay in the $200-$300 MSRP range. Many will scoff at MSRP since secondary will be much much greater, but MSRP allows us to compare apples to apples. Off the cuff you might think that this is a horrible value, however the price alone doesn’t tell the whole story.

What stops this from being an absolute horrible value is the fact that the flavor profile is actually quite nuanced for such an old bourbon. Additionally, its 107 proof has to be taken into account for the value. By the time the bourbon has aged 23 years, only a very little remains in the barrel. Where Pappy Van Winkle 23 Year and Elijah Craigh 23 Year get proofed down to 95.6 and 90 proof respectively, Heaven Hill only proofs down Evan Williams 23 Year to 107 proof. This means that there is even less to bottle from each batch that they process for this line. So yes, this isn’t a good value in the grand scheme of things, however it’s also not a bourbon to avoid purley based on price either.","Evan Williams 23 Year goes to show you that even though bourbon isn’t meant to be aged this long, when done right, it can deliver a fine drinking experience.","Being aged 23 years, I expected to find an oak monster like I tend to notice in bottles of Elijah Craig 23 Year. Instead I walked away surprised at how much depth and nuanced sweeter flavors Evan William 23 Year brings to the table. Yes there are clear signs of its extensive time spent in the barrel, particularly in its finish. However its higher proof helps accentuate flavors you normally wouldn’t find in a bourbon that has been aged this long. There’s no denying that the price is incredibly high, however at the very least, it’s worth seeking out a pour to see what ultra aged bourbon can taste like if done right.",Jordan,4,3.5,2,4,2.5,3,https://www.breakingbourbon.com/review/evan-williams-23-years-old
,Evan Williams Bottled in Bond,Classification: Straight Bourbon,Company: Heaven Hill,Distillery: Heaven Hill,Released: Ongoing,Proof: 100,Age: NAS,"Mashbill: 78% Corn, 12% Malted Barley, and 10% Rye",Color:  Bright Gold,MSRP: $15 (2017),Official Website,"Evan Williams is one of Kentucky’s most prominent bourbon brands, with a portfolio that includes a multitude of bourbons, flavored whiskeys, and liqueurs. Evan Williams Bottled in Bond, otherwise referred to as Evan Williams White label, was introduced to the market in 2012. It shares the same mashbill as many other Heaven Hill brands.

This is a Bottled in Bond (BiB) bourbon. To be labelled BiB, the whiskey must be the product of one distillation season and one distiller at a single distillery, aged in a federally bonded warehouse under U.S. government supervision for at least four years, and it must be bottled at exactly 100 proof. Additionally, the BiB label must clearly identify the distillery where it was distilled and where it was bottled, if different.","Loads of sugary sweetness. Vanilla, caramel, a hint of gingerbread, and candied dark fruit pour forth from the glass in a balanced array sweet scents. It’s light on alcohol and absent of any woody or oak notes making it quite nice, albeit heavy handed with the sweeter elements.","It almost flattens out on my tongue, settling in the base of my mouth without the spicy, tingly pop on the roof of my mouth that I sometimes notice with higher proof bourbons. Like the nose, flavors of wood and oak are absent here, as sweet notes of vanilla, caramel, burnt brown sugar, and a touch of black pepper take over. It’s full flavored and assertive with a welcomed amount of heat, though I would still describe it as smooth for its proof. It has character, but it’s not complex by any means as it has a somewhat one-dimensional focus on sweeter elements.","The sweet elements from the palate dissipate quickly with a crisp and abrupt drop-off. A subtle bit of oak creeps in after that, giving way to a fairly dry, medium-length finish.","As many Heaven Hill brands share the same mashbill and similar age range, it’s not surprising that the overall flavor profile is a somewhat familiar one. I compared it directly with Evan Williams Black, Heaven Hill BiB, and Henry McKenna BiB. I’ll save the detailed results of the comparison for a future Breaking Bourbon Face Off, but in simple terms side by side, each of these bourbons does offer its own distinguishing characteristics, as subtle as they may be. Not surprisingly, Evan Williams Black offers the closest comparison in flavor profile, and while the BiB version has an all around fuller flavor profile and heavier mouthfeel, some wood and fruit characteristics not found in the BiB version make an appearance in the Black. Evan Williams BiB is just one of the numerous non age-stated Heaven Hill bourbons and while it’s flavor profile is more traditional and somewhat one-dimensional, it still offers subtle characteristics unique to the brand and delivers them in its own unique way.","While you could compare this directly with Heaven Hill BiB (6 year old) at $12 and say the Evan Williams BiB is younger and more expensive at $15, I would argue that you’re just comparing two bourbons that both offer exceptional value. Despite the lack of an age statement (though a minimum of four years can be inferred from the label), Evan Williams BiB is actually a five year product according to Heaven Hill Brand Ambassador Bernie Lubbers, so really just one year shy of Heaven Hill BiB. The flavor profiles are also different, with Evan Williams BiB trading a bit of Heaven Hill BiB’s balance for some additional character and sweetness. Furthermore, while we know the distribution of Heaven Hill BiB is quite limited outside of Kentucky, Evan Williams BiB is distributed nationwide. As a result, the added cost of a trip to Kentucky to pick up some Heaven Hill BiB (not to mention a few Willetts, some gift shop only releases, every other BiB whiskey known to man, followed by a week of sleeping alone on the couch…) might help justify the $3 price increase you’ll pay for the Evan Williams BiB at your local store.

While there isn’t anything about Evan Williams BiB’s flavor profile that’s necessarily great, there really isn’t anything bad about it either. Tasting it blind, I’d wager most would guess its MSRP to be north of $25. By that measure it’s a tremendous value for only $15.","Full flavored but still smooth, this sweet tasting BiB bourbon won’t wow you, but offers enough versatility to make it a mainstay in any home bar, all for less than $20.","While not exceptional by any means, Evan Williams BiB is an appealing and versatile bourbon with tremendous value. It’s sweet yet assertive flavor profile offers mass appeal with just enough dimension and potency to work any way you like it, from sipping neat to mixing in cocktails and everything in between. With a $15 price tag and national distribution, there’s no reason not to pick up a bottle the next chance you get.",Nick,3,3,2.5,2.5,4,3,https://www.breakingbourbon.com/review/evan-williams-bottled-in-bond
,Evan Williams Single Barrel - 2011 Vintage,Classification: Straight Bourbon,Company: Heaven Hill,Distillery: Heaven Hill,Release Date: Ongoing (2011 Vintage released 2018-2019),Proof: 86.6,"Age: 7 Years, 10 Months (Each single barrel is approximately 7-8 years old)","Mashbill: 78% Corn, 12% Rye, 10% Malted Barley",Color: Gold,MSRP: $27 (2020),Official Website,"Evan Williams is one of Kentucky’s most prominent bourbon brands, with a portfolio that includes a multitude of bourbons, flavored whiskeys, and liqueurs. Evan Williams Single Barrel is the brand’s most premium ongoing release. The vintage date on the bottle is representative of the year the bourbon was put into oak, with year-over-year vintages being released on an ongoing and consistent basis, often with multiple vintages found on store shelves simultaneously. Over time, the brand has trended from approximately 10 years old to approximately 7-8 years old.  

The bottle in review is from barrel number 64, barreled on 1/5/2011, and bottled on 11/16/2018. This information is handwritten on the back of each bottle.","Sweet caramel and vanilla contrast graham cracker and seasoned oak. A touch of toasted marshmallow rounds things out. This traditional array of aromas may be light in its intensity, but offers above average refinement and is surprisingly satisfying nonetheless.","Aged oak is most noticeable, but finds itself in balance with other complimentary flavors including caramel, Cinnamon Toast Crunch, and a hint of pepper. These flavors are noticeably rich and developed despite the bourbon’s low proof. Even more surprising, while the bourbon looks thin in the glass, it coats the inside of the mouth nicely offering an above average mouthfeel.","A peppery kick starts things off and is drawn out against sweeter notes of caramel and vanilla. Oak maintains its presence, with a trace of tobacco teasing the taste buds. Medium in length, the finish brings everything together nicely and leaves a lingering spice on the tongue.","Evan Williams Single Barrel is a slightly older, slightly higher proofed, and of course single barrel version of the standard Evan Williams Black that comes in at 4-5 years old and 86 proof. Evan Williams Single Barrel will vary by barrel, but over the years, it has proved to be a generally straightforward, traditional style bourbon. It offers evidence of oak in its flavor profile, but balances that nicely with some sweeter flavors. At 86.6 proof, it’s approachable for  many.

While none of this is extraordinarily unique nowadays, the one feature I do like about Evan Williams Single Barrel is the vintage dating on the bottles, each adorned with the year the bourbon was put into oak (along with the exact barreling date and bottling date handwritten on the back of the label). The idea of vintage, which is much more commonly associated with wine, allows you to easily date the bourbon. While every single barrel whiskey has a vintage, not every one is easily identified, especially those in standard production (as compared to private selections where more details are typically offered). This simple dating concept, along with a plentiful supply, allows fans to easily grab a bottle or two of each year as they're released. I often hunt for dates of significance - a child’s birthday, anniversary, and so on. This makes collecting bottles easy and fun, with the intent of some day looking back at decades of vintage dated bottles and opening them up to taste year-over-year in an epic Evan Williams Single Barrel vintage tasting.","A sub-$30 price tag amidst the growing number of bourbon releases and exploding popularity is more striking year after year. While 2-3 year old bourbons striving for attention often enter the market at $40 or more, sometimes we might even forget about those increasingly familiar less expensive bottles sitting on the shelf.

Evan Williams Single Barrel has come down a bit in age over the years, but still maintains about 7-8 years for less than $30. Its low proof can also be pointed to as a detractor, however the bourbon offers a surprisingly rich flavor profile despite its low proof, and many consumers really aren’t seeking out mouth-searing proofs anyway. Evan Williams Single Barrel might be a head scratcher in the sense that it’s low proof, but enthusiast-oriented with it being a single barrel and offering vintage dating. However, it has a rich flavor profile and comes in at an affordable price. It’s consistently landed on our Best $20-$30 Bourbons list for a reason - great flavor and availability, after all it is the lowest cost and most easily accessible single barrel on the market.","Evan Williams Single Barrel might be low proof, but its enjoyable flavor profile, vintage dating, handwritten details, and affordable price tag make it a bourbon everyone should have on their shelf.","Sometimes it’s worth getting excited over the seemingly unexciting. Evan Williams Single Barrel has become so familiar it can be easy to forget about. With an onslaught of new labels, the sub-$30 tried and true is sometimes left to gather dust on the shelves. While it may not offer the magic some barrels of Henry McKenna can, or the intensity of flavor found in Knob Creek Single Barrel, Evan Williams Single Barrel offers a traditional and consistent flavor profile at an affordable price. The good news is you won’t need to scour every liquor store in town for a bottle either.",Nick,3,3,3,3,3,3,https://www.breakingbourbon.com/review/evan-williams-single-barrel-2011-vintage

Specifically the 125th anniversary edition contains a mixture of OBSV (18yrs), OBSK (13yrs), and OESK (13 yrs). The normal recipe for Four Roses small batch is comprised of a four recipe mixture (OBSO, OBSK, OESK, OESO) that contains no associated age statement. The standard small batch is bottled at 90 proof while this special edition was released at barrel strength.","Bringing the glass up to my nose, I was greeted with a delicious mixture of smells. Light traces of wheat, fresh berries and floral smells stand out with subtle aftertones of fresh nuts and new wood. I was surprised to find that for a 100+ proof bourbon, you have to try very hard to pick up even the slightest hint of alcohol. No burn here, just a wonderfully scented whiskey that I kept going back to to smell more of throughout the tasting.","What jumped out to me immediately was a mixture of old leather and aged cedar like a cigar box. Additionally, the berry smell from the nose continues on in the palate and you get light hints of sweet berries and dried fruit. An odd combination, but it blends surprisingly well.","The finish on this was very mild and shorter than I would have preferred. You have a big buildup in the nose and palate, but the finish left me wanting more than what it delivered. The finish was dry like aged leather with hints of tobacco leaves. I also picked up subtle traces of slight bitterness like an orange rind.","While Four Roses releases a limited edition small batch every year, this version is as unique as it gets. The normal small batch recipe uses four strains (OBSO, OBSK, OESK, OESO) versus the three strains found in the 125th Anniversary edition (OBSO at 18yrs, OBSK at 13yrs, OESK 13 yrs). It’s really interesting to see how modifying what is blended together for this release changes the flavor profile from a normal small batch bottle. Only 12,468 total bottles were released (approximately 8,000 bottles in US markets) and like most limited edition Four Roses releases, this version was snapped up very quickly by the general public.","At $85, this is almost three times the price of a normal bottle of Four Roses small batch. While it’s nice to try different flavors and say that you've sampled a one-off bottle from Four Roses, I have a hard time justifying the price. The normal small batch release is quite a steal at $30 and is really good for the price. Comparing the 125th Anniversary release to the everyday small batch, I walked away feeling slightly disappointed with it. At $85, I was expecting a bourbon that would blow me away - one that was so much more than the usual small batch release.",A big buildup with a lackluster finish.,"I wanted this bourbon to rate higher, however I came away from the tasting feeling slightly disappointed. Don’t get me wrong, this is a very fine bourbon that is well worth a try. However, seeing as this was so many people’s top choice bourbon of 2013, I was excited when we finally opened our bottle here at Breaking Bourbon. I was expecting to be blown away, but it didn’t knock my socks off like other releases from 2013 such as Elijah Craig 21yr, for example. This release from Four Roses starts off strong with a great nose, but just loses its appeal from there.

I’d still recommend you try a taste if you find it in your local bourbon bar, but don’t feel bad if you weren’t able to pick up a bottle for your personal collection.",Jordan,4,3.5,2.5,4.5,2,3,https://www.breakingbourbon.com/review/four-roses-2013-limited-edition-small-batch
,Four Roses Small Batch,Classification: Straight Bourbon,Company: Kirin Brewery Company,Distillery: Four Roses,Released: Ongoing,Proof: 90,Age: NAS,"Mashbill: Blend of 75% Corn, 20% Rye, 5% Malted Barley and 60% Corn, 35% Rye, 5% Malted Barley",Color:  Honey,MSRP: $30 (2017),Official Website,"Four Roses uses 2 different mashbills and 5 different yeast strains to create 10 unique bourbon recipes. Of those recipes, 4 are blended together to make Small Batch - OBSK, OESK, OBSO, and OESO. The first letter is always O and designates the production facility, Four Roses Distillery. The second letter designates the mashbill which can be E (75% corn, 20% rye, 5% malted barley) or B (60% corn, 35% rye, 5% malted barley). The third letter is always S and designates the whiskey distillation, straight whiskey. The fourth letter designates the yeast strain, which can be V (delicate fruit), K (slight spice), O (rich fruit), Q (floral essence), or F (herbal notes).

According to master distiller Brent Elliott, while exact details vary by batch, the average batch size is approximately 250 barrels. Barrels are typically 6 and 7 years old, with nothing younger than 6 years old and occasionally barrels as much as 8 years old. As a result, the average age per batch is typically around 6 ½ years old. Bourbon from each of the 4 recipes is always used to comprise each batch, with 2-3 batches (of each of the 4 recipes) typically included in each batch. Because of the required flavor profile and volume demand, barrels typically come from multiple aging rickhouses to make up each batch. Prior to dumping, representative samples are pulled from each batch of each recipe to be blended and tested in the lab. A lot of test blending and batch evaluation is necessary to fine tune with test blends prior to dumping because the results of the combined test blends can be surprising.

Four Roses uses single story rickhouses to age their bourbon in barrels that have undergone a 45 second burn (resulting in a char level that falls between #3 and #4).","Oak, citrus fruit, and a hint of spice lay atop a bed of caramel. It’s light and approachable, but not characteristically unique.","The mouthfeel is nice and creamy. A dimension of flavors offers enough to create interest, and they manage to keep one another in check. While the flavors are all a bit timid, oak, summer fruit, cherries, caramel, and rye spice are the most prominent. I detect echoes of additional flavors, but they’re so delicate it’s hard to say what exactly. Four Roses Small Batch is easy on the palate, and while the combination of flavors is quite pleasant, the delivery is so delicate it has me thirsting for a bit more oomph.","The oomph I was looking for in the palate comes out in the finish. Long in duration, the complexity of the sip shines here, giving in to the dimension of flavors present in this four recipe blend. The flavors of oak, summer fruits, and caramel come forward against a backdrop of rye spice and seasoned oak. It’s hands down the best part of the experience, and invites you back for more.","The four recipe blend is easily this bourbon’s most unique quality at first glance, but what does that translate to? It’s not a one-trick pony. Rather, it’s quite the opposite. Given a chance to take your time with it, you’ll discover this bourbon offers a balance of flavors without any single element overpowering the others. Its got just the right amount of oak, just the right amount of spice, just the right amount of caramel, and just the right amount of fruity pep. While subtle, there’s enough to hold your attention and invite you back for more. A small batch bourbon with a balanced flavor profile might seem as average as they come, but Four Roses’ ability to do it so consistently well is what sets this bourbon apart.","While the experience isn’t a knock-your-socks-off explosion of flavor, it is quality bourbon for the price. Its style fits in nicely between the less exciting Four Roses Yellow and more flavorful Four Roses Single Barrel. While Single Barrel is without question a better bourbon, it comes with a 33% increase in price. Because of this, Small Batch is perfectly priced within its own lineup, but also offers great value relative to many other bourbons in the $30 price range. It really comes down to personal preference, because I think Four Roses achieves exactly what they set out to with Small Batch. It’s a good deal, plain and simple. And if it’s not on your shelf at home, it should be.","Quality, balanced, and affordable - while Four Roses Small Batch won’t blow your mind, it can hold its own against just about any other bourbon in its price range.","Four Roses succeeds at offering quality bourbons with mass appeal. Their process is enviable, and their products prove it. Small Batch delivers a great mouthfeel and impeccable balance of flavors, but in a subtle package. It’s priced right within its own lineup and a great value within the $30 price range. Small Batch is a bourbon that just about anyone should at least find something to like, and some will even find something to love.",Nick,2.5,3,3.5,2.5,3,3,https://www.breakingbourbon.com/review/four-roses-small-batch
,George Dickel Rye Whisky,Classification: Rye,Company: Diageo/George Dickel,"Distillery: MGP Ingredients, Inc.",Released: Ongoing,Proof: 90,Age: NAS (Rumored to be around 5 years),"Mashbill: 95% Rye, 5% Malted Barley",Color:  Light Copper,MSRP: $25 (2017),Official Website,"George Dickel is known for using only two mashbills. All four of their whiskeys consist of 84% corn, 8% rye, and 8% malted barley, while their single rye product consists of 95% rye and 5% malted barley. Interestingly enough, this rye is distilled by MGP that is chilled and filtered through charcoal made of sugar maple wood by George Dickel. It is aged in George Dickel warehouses in char #4 barrels with a #2 head. This is the same char level used for aging other Dickel whiskys.","A very approachable and inviting nose is instantly noticeable. Sweet notes of vanilla, marshmallow, lightly charred wood, fallen leaves, and a hint of grilled peaches. It’s a different combination, but one that works well. Surprisingly enough, the hints of rye grain that are present, aren’t as plentiful as I expected for a whiskey with a 95% rye mashbill.","Any misdirection the nose may have created that this wasn’t a high rye is instantly quashed in the palate. My mouth is flooded with a heavy dose of creamy spiced rye grain. The palate has a familiar MGP flavor profile, however it’s clear that the Dickel charcoal filtering process has left its mark. Sweet vanilla and marshmallow follow the rye spice and combine to make for one very enjoyable palate. It’s not complex, but its delightful creamy profile makes it extremely easy to sip on.","The rye carries through to the finish and is consistent throughout. After a few moments, light hints of white pepper, oak, and leather subtly enter the picture and then subtly exit a few moments later leaving a dry rye characteristic to chew on for several minutes. The finish contains little to no heat and continues on the trend found in the palate of making this extremely easy to drink.","Similar to Rittenhouse Rye Bottled in Bond, I found Dickel Rye to be extremely approachable, but in a slightly different way. Where Rittenhouse is easy to recommend for its ability to help bridge a typical bourbon drinker into the world of rye due to its sweeter characteristics, I feel that Dickel Rye is the next logical evolution as individuals explore the world of ryes. You still have an approachable nose that is unique, yet also inviting to bourbon drinkers. This is followed by a palate and finish that deliver a more traditional rye experience thanks to its 95% rye content. While classic rye characteristics are present in the palate and finish, there is no doubt that the unique Dickel charcoal filtering process has left its mark. The end result is a rye that forgoes exotic flavors and sticks to ones that are straightforward and easy to dissect. The 90 proof is perfectly balanced and allows the flavors to nicely shine through with very little heat being present. This is truly the definition of an easy sipping rye.","Lately it seems to get harder and harder to find an approachable whiskey for under $25. Sure more whiskeys than ever are appearing on the shelf, but many of these are young or sacrifice quality for price. Dickel not only comes in at a reasonable price, but it also delivers a whiskey with a high rye content that isn’t seen among its peers at this price point.

Much like I found Rittenhouse Rye to be a good value, I feel Dickel Rye falls right in the same camp. It still may not present the spiciest of profiles that hardcore rye drinkers crave, however it delivers an extremely approachable sipping rye, all for $25 or less. That’s hard to beat in today’s market.","Able to be appreciated by both new and veteran whiskey drinkers, George Dickel Rye delivers an enjoyable experience at a fantastic price.","There’s not much to hate about Dickel’s sole rye whiskey. Sure it may not be the most complex rye you’ll ever sip on, but it will deliver a sip that you want to keep going back to. In fact I found myself going back more and more than I usually do when I review a whiskey. For years I used to pass this on the shelf thinking that I’ll get to it eventually, or telling myself how good can this be for $25. I now wholeheartedly regret that mindset, because this is one rye that you’ll be hard pressed not to like.",Jordan,3,3.5,3,3,3,3,https://www.breakingbourbon.com/review/george-dickel-rye-whiskey
,Henry McKenna Single Barrel,Classification: Straight Bourbon,Company: Heaven Hill,Distillery: Heaven Hill,Released: Ongoing,Proof: 100,Age: 10 Years,"Mashbill:  78% Corn, 12% Malted Barley, and 10% Rye",Color:  Amber,MSRP: $30 (2017),Official Website,"Henry McKenna came to America in 1837 from Ireland and settled in Kentucky where he set out to create a better bourbon using his family’s recipe. Today, Heaven Hill offers Henry McKenna Single Barrel which is aged for 10 years and satisfies the Bottled in Bond (BiB) requirements. To be labelled BiB, the whiskey must be the product of one distillation season and one distiller at a single distillery, aged in a federally bonded warehouse under U.S. government supervision for at least four years, and it must be bottled at exactly 100 proof. Additionally, the BiB label must clearly identify the distillery where it was distilled and where it was bottled, if different.

Henry McKenna Single Barrel shares the same mashbill as many other Heaven Hill brands (75% corn, 13% rye, 12% malted barley). Though it carries an MSRP of $30, it tends to range in price from $25-$35. The bottle being reviewed is from barrel number 2068 which was barreled on 02/07/05.",Traditional notes of caramel and vanilla play against a backdrop of seasoned oak. Alcohol mixes in and holds its weight against the other scents as you might expect for 100 proof. It’s not great but it’s not bad either.,"Vanilla and seasoned oak take the forefront, but are quickly balanced by a good dose of rye spice, a pop of burnt brown sugar, and a dollop of caramel. It’s not complex, but rather a fine balance of traditional bourbon flavors with just the right amounts of oak, spice, and sweeter elements contrasting one another in harmony. It has a satisfying mouthfeel and the 100 proof plays perfectly, providing just the right amount of burn without overdoing it.","Medium length with a balanced tapering of the flavors and spicy burn from the palate. A hint of leather creeps in but doesn’t overpower the oak and vanilla which dominate here as in the palate. Despite 10 years in the barrel, it’s anything but over-oaked, though the oak is present from nose to finish affirming the barrel’s role in this bourbon’s maturation.","Henry McKenna Single Barrel can be described as traditional; a quintessential bourbon flavor profile with the potential for subtle hints of magic if you happen to find a special barrel. While I will give some credit for uniqueness based on the fact that it’s a 10 year age stated BiB single barrel bourbon, I cannot say that those traits result in a unique flavor profile and as a result, carry less weight for me in this category than they might otherwise. But alas, the lack of a unique flavor profile is not always a bad thing, as a quintessential bourbon flavor profile is sometimes just what the doctor ordered.","With age statements dropping in waves from everyday bourbons, including the recent loss of Elijah Craig Small Batch’s 12 year age statement, McKenna’s front and center 10 year age statement sitting amongst other $30 bourbons now seems to stand out like never before. While a higher age does not necessarily equate to a better bourbon, it does signify a milestone that must be attained before the barrel can be selected and bottled. It’s a hard line, and younger “ready enough” bourbon cannot simply be substituted to increase production, presumably compromising quality or desired flavor profile as corporate pressures compete with the skillful selection of barrels in the rickhouse. In addition, single barrel bourbons are generally considered to be drawn from the honey barrels as they must be taken as is; distillers do not have the option to blend them into other barrels to achieve the desired end result. Finally, being BiB results in a bottling proof of 100 which some consider an ideal proof and one that is higher than many other bourbons on the shelf for around $30. When it comes to the technicals there are close comparisons at this price point, but none of them carry the combination of a 10 year age statement, single barrel, and BiB.

While all this makes McKenna look like the class Valedictorian on paper, the question of value then becomes a subjective question of taste. Henry McKenna closely resembles the limited edition 2013 Parker’s Heritage Collection “Promise of Hope” single barrel bourbon in mash bill, proof, age, and style. While not of the same caliber, my strong affinity for Parker’s Promise of Hope makes me admittedly partial to McKenna’s flavor profile as they share the same traditional, quintessential no gimmicks characteristics.

I’ve sampled from three different McKenna barrels and while I’ve found them all to be in within the same range, I will say one was a little better than the other two. A function of single barrel selection no doubt, I still feel each was a great value for the price. Coupled with the technicals this is very simply a great deal for around $30. Unfortunately, McKenna’s relative value now seems so obvious that I can only assume it might be one of the next on the chopping block. Either the age statement will drop, or the price will pop.","Henry McKenna offers an array of technicals to satisfy even the most scrutinizing bourbon purists, a satisfying quintessential bourbon flavor profile to back them up, and a price that won’t break the bank.","Henry McKenna Single Barrel offers a traditional and quintessential flavor profile that should appeal to nearly every bourbon enthusiast. Its 10 year age statement and BiB designation should satisfy bourbon purists. If there is anyone still left unsatisfied, a $30 price tag should help lift their spirits. While this bourbon probably won’t blow anyone’s mind, you’d be hard-pressed to find a bourbon enthusiast who couldn’t find something to like with it.",Nick,2.5,3.5,2.5,2.5,3.5,3,https://www.breakingbourbon.com/review/henry-mckenna-single-barrel

Subtle and easy to sip, but not incredibly complex.",Medium length finish with softening elements of the palate. I didn’t pick up anything new here but it fades away nicely.,"Son of Bourye gets into the increasingly popular area of blending bourbon and rye but doesn’t have much much of a wow factor like some of the other juice produced by High West. Despite that, it has that textbook sweet bourbon flavor with the added spice of a rye, so it strikes a nice balance of sweet and spicy to make it an easy sipper with a little something extra.","High West seems to have squeezed all of the value out of two 5 year olds by making the sum of the parts worth the $40 Son of Bourye goes for, although I probably wouldn’t go out of my way to find this one. I would put it on par with Wild Turkey Forgiven, which goes for $50 and may not be as easy to find. All-in this is decent stuff for a fair price.",Textbook bourbon flavor with a little added spice for a fair price.,"Although there aren’t too many bourbon-rye blends to choose from, I’m not all that convinced these blends are anything special just because they have both bourbon and rye parts. To me, a good blend is all about the end result, and I don’t really care if it’s a blend of both bourbon and rye as long as it’s good. For marketing purposes the idea of both bourbon and rye sounds really cool, but in the end it boils down to whiskey created with some combination of the same basic ingredients as any other whiskey may have. I rated this one a 3 in all categories, and would have to say it’s the textbook definition of “Above Average” in all regards. Although it didn’t wow me, it didn’t disappoint me either. It’s a great option for a new whiskey drinker to try if you’re ready to move past the $30 per bottle mark and try something a little different.",Nick,3,3,3,3,3,3,https://www.breakingbourbon.com/review/high-west-son-of-bourye
,Jack Daniel's Single Barrel Barrel Proof,Classification: Tennessee Whiskey,Company: Brown-Forman,Distillery: Jack Daniel's Distillery,Released: Ongoing,Proof: 130.6,Age: NAS,"Mashbill: 80% Corn, 12% Rye, 8% Malted Barley",Color:  Deep Amber,MSRP: $65 (2017),Official Website,"While not labeled bourbon, most Tennessee whiskeys meet the criteria required to be called bourbon. After distillation, Jack Daniel’s Tennessee Whiskey undergoes what is referred to as the Lincoln County Process. In the case of Jack Daniel’s, it drips for six days in 10 foot vats, passing through charcoal that was made by burning maple wood that had been impregnated with 140 proof Jack Daniel’s whiskey before being put in new charred oak barrels and aged for an estimated 4-7 years.

Jack Daniel’s pulls barrels from the upper levels of the rickhouse for their single barrel bottlings, with the barrel proof version being released in varying proofs ranging from 125 to 140. This is the first time that Jack Daniel’s has offered their single barrel product to the public in barrel strength form.

The bottle in review is from rick number L-28, barrel number 15-7601, and has a bottling date of 12/15/2015.","A combination of maple sugar candy and bananas lies on a bed of burnt wood. It has a somewhat smoky scent, and though the alcohol is noticeable, it’s not overpowering. It’s rich and inviting, yet uncharacteristic of what I’m used to in American whiskey.","Chocolatey sweet caramel and burnt wood hit first. Pipe tobacco follows, along with a good dose of bananas, some nuttiness, a bit of spice, and some of that maple sugar candy. While I can’t necessarily pinpoint any other specific flavors, the overall mix comes across as somewhat odd, albeit enjoyable. This odd mix of flavors is assertive, but not to the extent I would have expected for 130.6 proof, feeling closer to 100 proof on the palate. It coats the mouth nicely with a medium-weight mouthfeel.","The heat kicks in here, quickly ramping up to a spicy almost tannic burn giving evidence of the higher proof. I might go so far as to say it borders on overly hot, culminating in the mouth and back of the throat, which might be a bit much for some. This makes for a bold and spicy finish, and though the intense heat dissipates quickly, it leaves ample amounts of burnt wood and maple sugar candy lingering in balance for quite some time.","I don’t intend to offend any die hard Jack Daniel’s fans by saying this, but I have never held Jack Daniel’s in high esteem. In my mind I’ve always associated the brand with mass-produced mixing whiskey, which is not necessarily a correct assertion but rather based strictly on my own limited personal experience; mostly in college, mixing the flagship Old No. 7 with coke, and typically followed up with a good ol’ toilet hugging session. Those were the days, right?

Years later I approach whiskey in a much different way, typically enjoying neat and always seeking out new, quality experiences. As a result, the buzz surrounding this particular product has successfully landed Jack Daniel’s on my radar. In anticipation of writing this review, I did some exploration into Jack Daniel’s history beyond the modern-day buzz surrounding the Lincoln County Process and heated discussions as to whether or not it’s actually bourbon, which for the record, I don’t care.

What surprised me most is something I already knew but needed a reminder of. The brand is rich with history dating back to the the late 1800’s, so much so that in 1972 the Jack Daniel’s Distillery was listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Despite its mass-produced and run-of-the-mill surface level feel, on paper Jack Daniel’s gives purists everything they want; the company makes their own barrels, distills and ages their own whiskey, and shares a reasonable amount of information with those who are interested in seeking it out.

As for the flavor profile of this whiskey, it’s uncharacteristic of others in my collection and pushes the limits on a flavor profile I would typically go for, which is accentuated by it being barrel proof. I’ve sampled from two different Jack Daniels Single Barrel Barrel Proof bottlings, and while both share some underlying similarities, they offer very different experiences, with the bottle in review having a fuller flavor profile and providing a more interesting experience by comparison. My particular bottle is by no means a perfect balance of flavors, but what it offers is exciting, unique tasting, and enjoyable; albeit a somewhat strange mix of flavors. Love it or hate it, it’s unique yet polarizing flavor profile might just be one of the best things it has going for it.","Barrel proof options offer some of the better values in whiskey, and as a result, selection is often limited as they don’t tend to sit on the shelves for long (despite rapidly increasing prices in some cases). Single barrel private selections, often bottled at barrel proof, represent a good comparison to this product as there seems to be a good amount of variation between barrels and the price range is similar. Depending on your taste preference and pure luck, you’re sometimes rewarded with an exceptional bottle, and other times not so much. The risk is no different here.

However, unlike some popular comparisons that would include private selections of Four Roses and Smooth Ambler Old Scout, I feel the quality floor and chance of liking Jack Daniel’s are lower, resulting in a higher probability of a not-so-enjoyable bottle (anecdotally speaking). On the flip side, you might just end up with a unique tasting bottle you love that’s also unlike anything else in your collection. Of course $65 is a premium price point, and while I don’t feel there is a stellar deal here, I don’t feel it’s overpriced either.","While there seems to be wide variation among barrels, this full-flavored, unique, yet polarizing barrel proof whiskey showcases an historic brand, and might just make us think of Jack Daniel’s a little differently.","On the surface, Jack Daniel’s Single Barrel Barrel Proof is a tough whiskey to wholeheartedly get behind. While I really enjoy the particular bottle/barrel I’ve reviewed here, there seems to be a significant variation among barrels and taste preference for it, with most enthusiasts generally loving or hating it. Coupled with a unique flavor profile, you’re rolling the dice on the quality of your particular bottle and whether the flavor profile will be to your liking. If you have an adventurous palate and enjoy full-flavored whiskeys, you might be rewarded in the best of ways. On the flip side, you might downright hate it.

Despite the risk, I still recommend it. In a worst case scenario you’ll end up with a nice looking bottle of whiskey to add to your collection for the sole purpose of sharing with adventurous friends. In any event, it’s great to see Jack Daniel’s raising proof instead of lowering it and giving us a product to get excited about. I was so shocked by how much I enjoyed this bottle that I ended up naming it as one of my Favorite Whiskeys of 2015; not because I think it’s a perfect whiskey, but because it really impressed me with it’s surprisingly enjoyable combination of rich and unique flavors making it one of my most memorable whiskeys for 2015.",Nick,3,3.5,3,4,2.5,3,https://www.breakingbourbon.com/review/jack-daniels-single-barrel-barrel-proof
,Jack Daniel's Single Barrel Rye,Classification: Rye,Company: Brown-Forman,Distillery: Jack Daniel's Distillery,Released: Ongoing,Proof: 94,Age: NAS,"Mashbill: 70% Rye, 18% Corn, 12% Malted Barley",Color: Amber,MSRP: $50 (2017),Official Website,"Jack Daniel’s created their “first new grain bill in 100 years” for the creation of their rye whiskey. The Single Barrel Rye is the company’s third rye release. They started with “Unaged Rye” in 2012, followed by “Rested Rye” in 2014. According to the company, the whiskey uses the same cave spring water from the Jack Daniel’s Hollow and proprietary yeast that’s been used in the distillery’s 150-year-old Tennessee Whiskey recipe. The whiskey is aged in the upper regions of their barrel house where it’s exposed to the increased temperature variation. The Single Barrel Rye is at least 4 years old based on the lack of age statement on its label, although the company hasn’t officially called it as such. Jack Daniel’s has confirmed with us that they have plans to release a new rye product in 2017, which we expect to be aged an additional year over the current Single Barrel Rye.

The bottle being reviewed is from barrel number 16-2534, rick number L-2, and bottled on 4/11/16.","A welcoming array of cherry and banana, offset by bouts of custard, oak, and faint rye spice. A dash of ethanol is present but doesn’t sabotage an otherwise nice experience. Enjoyable, and surprisingly tame in intensity, what’s definitely notable is the restraint and overall gentleness this young whiskey is sporting. This isn’t a typical bombastic rye whiskey nose, for better or for worse.","It tastes a bit simple at first. A heavy dose of banana is upfront that’s followed by caramel and cherry. The palate never quite fully develops into an array of flavors. Instead, the highlight here is its very enjoyable buttery mouthfeel that simply settles on a baked plantain, oak, and rye spice blend that’s straightforward and satisfying. Slightly reminiscent of Jack Daniel’s No 7 flavors and characteristics the whiskey is known for, but still its own beast.",There’s a noticeable ethanol bite on the finish that’s saddled with rye spice and oak. Lasting notes of cinnamon and vanilla ride out this medium length finish. It’s on the dry side and easily the whiskey’s weakest link.,"With rye’s increased popularity, many new ryes have popped up on store shelves over the past few years. The majority of them have been sourced from MGP, resulting in a very similar tasting landscape. Even some of the Kentucky majors, like Woodford and Jim Beam, released new rye whiskeys, and in their particular cases have been downright lackluster. In Jack Daniel’s case though, this Single Barrel Rye is one of the more interesting and unique ryes, especially for how young it is.

Jack Daniel’s Single Barrel Rye is the third rye product the company has released in four years and it’s clear with each release, that this line is showing more and more potential. It has a buttery mouthfeel that’s reminiscent of Sazerac 18’s, and is fruit-forward rather than spice-forward like so many typical ryes. If the past few years of rye releases have taught me anything, it’s that rye whiskeys generally don’t taste like this.","Asking $50 for a NAS rye that is known to be only about 4 years old from a company with no previous rye whiskey making experience is a lot to swallow. Jack Daniel’s can only rely on their brand recognition to a point, before people ultimately ask, “why is this one of the more expensive ryes on the market?” Perhaps it’s simple conditioning to the price point over many years instead of a price increase with every release. For now though, it’s really a leap of faith as word-of-mouth is only now just beginning to swell about it.

Kudos is due to Jack Daniel’s for having the grit to release their new and untested rye as a single barrel. This likely has an effect on its higher price, but also might be adding a lot of additional character that might have been lost if it was released as a batched whiskey. Of course being a single barrel, variations do occur. After tasting three different bottles of this, two have been easily above average and one has been just above average. Regardless of the variations, it still showed me the potential this product has. It may not have convinced me to go out and purchase another bottle of this current release, but I certainly will with another year of aging under its belt.",A unique tasting and buttery rye that’s already showing signs of greatness even at a young age.,"With the rye field so crowded it’s harder than ever to stand out. Credit is due to Jack Daniel’s for their Single Barrel Rye. The company did what few of the other major distilleries succeeded in doing with their rye whiskeys, they piqued my interest by providing something unique, along with a reason to continually seek this out with each new release. Potential doesn’t guarantee future success, but judging from each iteration of Jack Daniel’s rye offerings, they’re slowly producing an upward-trending track record. I can’t quite get behind its asking price just yet, but if they also offered a $40 batched product, I probably would still gravitate to the $50 single barrel and all of the risk and reward that comes with it. For now, with expectations in check, rye drinkers should find a lot to enjoy with the current Jack Daniel’s Single Barrel Rye, all while knowing even better things just might be on the horizon.",Eric,3,3,2,3.5,2,3,https://www.breakingbourbon.com/review/jack-daniels-single-barrel-rye

The bottle in review is from rick number L-8, barrel number 15-2357, and has a bottling date of 5/19/2015.","This single barrel is clearly built on the bones of the standard Jack Daniel’s Old No. 7 offering. A delicious dose of banana bread, caramel, and heavily toasted oak, along with the slightest hint of ethanol are immediately noticeable. However, unlike the standard Jack Daniel’s, I’m happy to go back and keep smelling the nose on this whiskey. It’s an overall simple profile that is easy to enjoy and appreciate.","Caramel, toasted oak, and dried banana chips are immediately noticeable. The whiskey has a simple sweet flavor profile and medium-weight mouthfeel that allows it to easily be rolled around in my mouth. In fact, it drinks more like an 80 proof whiskey versus the actual 94 proof that it’s bottled at.","The finish is fairly one-dimensional, consisting of chewy charred oak and a dash of brown sugar mixed with white pepper. The finish lasts for a long time, with a peppery, dry, chewy charred oak taste that lingers for quite a while after the sip. After a tasty nose and palate, I was hoping that the finish would round out the experience. Instead, the finish is just average due heavily to its one-dimensional flavor profile.","Jack Daniel’s lines of whiskey have always been unique, and the single barrel version is no different. Their famous Jack Daniel’s Old No. 7 charcoal filtering is evident through the entire tasting experience and heavily influences the flavors. No other whiskeys out there taste anything quite like the resulting whiskey produced. The single barrel version is able to tone down this charcoal influence and turn it into an enjoyable, albeit near average, drinking experience.

Compared to the bold in-your-face Jack Daniel’s Single Barrel Barrel Proof edition, the single barrel version is much more balanced, and this is where the whiskey is at its best. It’s more well-rounded than the standard Jack Daniel’s, while also being much more balanced than the barrel proof version. The end result, while not mind blowing, is the most enjoyable drinking experience that Jack Daniel’s has to offer.","The standard Jack Daniel’s offering has been a staple for many individuals for its availability and low price point. It may not deliver a standout drinking experience, but it does deliver an economical one. At double the price of the standard Jack Daniel’s, the same can’t be said for Jack Daniel’s Single Barrel. While I find the flavor profile of the single barrel to be much better than the standard offering, there are also a lot of other whiskeys and bourbons in the marketplace that I would recommend in the $40-$50 price range before purchasing this.

That’s not a knock against this whiskey. Clearly the flavor profile may be more well-rounded than you find with the standard Jack Daniel’s, however in the end it’s not worth double the price. This seems to be the industry standard of other producers of single barrel whiskeys who tend to price their single barrel offerings much higher than their batched counterparts. That’s an okay pricing strategy to have when your single barrel offering is head and shoulders above and can compete well with its price point peers. Plain and simple though, this is a whiskey that should be selling more in the $35-$40 range versus the almost $50 it’s going for.",A well-rounded Jack Daniel’s experience that’s delivered at a not-so-well-rounded price point.,"Jack Daniel’s Single Barrel Select delivers an experience that I always felt the standard version was missing. The well-rounded nose and palate are tasty and help mellow out the charcoal influence while still delivering a distinctly Jack-like experience. However it’s not perfect either. While this is appreciated, the finish unfortunately falls forgettably flat. In addition, the almost $50 price point is hard to justify.

Jack Daniel’s flavor profile won’t be for everyone, and that’s okay. For those who are a fan of the standard Jack Daniel’s, this is worth picking up. While individual barrels will vary by taste, clearly effort was put forth in picking the best barrels available to offer to Jack fans. If you tend to shy away from Jack Daniel’s Old No. 7, but haven’t had a chance to try the single barrel offering yet, give this a try the next time you’re at your favorite watering hole. You just might end up pleasantly surprised by what you’ll find in this single barrel offering.",Jordan,3,3,2.5,3,2,3,https://www.breakingbourbon.com/review/jack-daniels-single-barrel-select

Rumors suggest there were 200 barrels total finished at sea, but this has not been confirmed. The bottleneck reads “Voyage No. 3” as compared with “Batch No. 15, Bottle No. 1917” on my bottle of Ocean II. We confirmed with Jefferson’s that this is the third release in the Ocean Aged At Sea series.

Be sure to check out: Ocean 2 Review, Ocean 4 Review and Q&A with Trey Zoeller.",A strong dose of raisins and citrus hits with a great deal more intensity than you’d expect for 90 proof.,"Raisins come through immediately and dominate the whole sip, making it very sweet throughout. Spice and alcohol come into play as well, ramping up quickly once the bourbon enters your mouth and pushing into the finish. Like the intensity on the nose, there’s more flavor and spice intensity than you’d expect for the proof.","Along with the spice the raisins continue to pull through. That citrus detected on the nose also makes itself present again. The intense spice drops off quickly leaving a faint but sweet, fruity aftertaste that continues to linger for a while.","Being the third ocean voyage from Jefferson’s with a rumored 200 barrels, I would estimate around 54,000 total bottles for this release. The bottle design has changed slightly from the second release and I’ll let you study our photos on this page and our Ocean II review page to find the nuances between them for yourself rather than try to explain them here. What this suggests is that Jefferson’s is making this an ongoing endeavor, so we might expect to see some consistency in flavor profile at some point.

For the time being, the flavor profile of this third release is very different from the previous one. Unfortunately, the intense contrast of bitter and sweet along with an incredibly rich mouthfeel found in Ocean II are completely lost on this third release. Jefferson’s delivers a more balanced and mainstream flavor profile with Ocean III, but sacrifices the characteristics I found to be the most appealing and unique with Ocean II. Knowing the time at sea for Ocean II was somewhere between 5-10 months (some rumors suggest 7-8 as a tighter range), and the fact that both II and III were released in 2014 suggests that their sea voyages were different times of the year and could have resulted in very different aging conditions while at sea. Alternatively, this is sourced bourbon and we have no clue where its from, so it could even be a completely different mash bill than Ocean II.

For me, this release lacks the unique flavor characteristics that would suggest an impact on flavor profile due to ocean aging. Not only that, the idea of aging at sea as something exciting is starting to wear off as Jefferson’s has released zero info on this particular voyage so far from what I could find.","$85, mash bill unknown, source unknown, age unknown, time at sea unknown, additional background unknown, decent overall bourbon. Except for the last item those are the facts. I argued adamantly in my Ocean II review that the concept of ocean aging is not a gimmick, which was based solely on my personal opinion of the flavor profile presented by Ocean II. The Ocean II has flavor characteristics I have never identified in another bourbon and I downright love the complexity of the sip. With this release, I’m not so sure. It’s a very good bourbon that maintains more balance and delivers a much sweeter sip than the last release. It’s good, but not $85 good. I’d peg this at around $40 considering the lack of background shared with the public and the quality of other bourbons I can buy in the $40 range.",A good bourbon overall… just completely different from Ocean II in a “Not quite as exciting” kind of way.,"With Ocean II, I was expecting to be disappointed but instead I was wowed. With this release, I was expecting to be wowed but instead I was disappointed. It’s possible that every ongoing Ocean release will have a different flavor profile and that Jefferson’s is sourcing totally different bourbon for each voyage. We just don’t know. These ocean aged bourbons have received much fanfare and continue to be controversial within the bourbon community, possibly to a greater extreme than any other bourbon out there. While this release is good overall, it left me feeling a little upset at spending $85 on a bottle. I’ll probably continue to get excited about these releases, but that’s contingent on Jefferson’s giving us some more background. If not, my excitement will probably wear off. Honesty is the best policy and, if you’re listening Trey, I think the community would really appreciate some of the finer details behind these ocean aged releases.

In 1779, they led 30 pioneer families to Madison Family County, Kentucky and established Bowman’s Station. Their great, great grandson, Abram S. Bowman, purchased Sunset Hills estate farm located in northern Virginia in 1929. Following the repeal of Prohibition, he found himself with an excess of corn, wheat, and rye by 1935 and opened a distillery on the property. The current A.

Bowman Single Barrel Bourbon is named after Colonel Bowman who was the first military commander and governor of Kentucky County.

A. Smith Bowman Distillery was purchased by the Sazerac Company, Inc. in 2003. Currently the company doesn’t produce their own whiskey distillate and doesn’t disclose who they source it from. It is believed the new make they use originates from Buffalo Trace and is their #1 mashbill. John J. Bowman Single Barrel is triple distilled. It’s unclear how many times A. Smith Bowman re-distills it through their unique copper still, but it is rumored to be twice distilled at Buffalo Trace and once at A. Smith Bowman. The company then ages the whiskey onsite. While no age statement is present, according to the company’s press materials John J. Bowman Single Barrel is aged between 9-10 years.","Baking chocolate, baked bread, oak, vanilla, and green apple, and a dash of toffee lead the way. A light tingling of ethanol is present but not so much to be distracting. The aromas aren’t overly strong, but more subtle and pleasant to the senses.","Taking a large sip reveals classic bourbon undertones with a touch of sweetness. It’s a creamy bodied bourbon that offers rich flavors. Rich malted chocolate, oak, vanilla, and hints of corn syrup immediately jump out. This is a bourbon that plays it safe in the sense that you won’t be overwhelmed with a massive set of flavors to dissect. That said, while it doesn’t have that wow factor of a standout bourbon, it sure doesn’t disappoint in what it delivers either.","Balanced and long. Warming heat slowly builds as it makes its way down your throat. A hint of spice in the form of green pepper, along with chocolate, leather, oak, and hints of vanilla start the finish. These flavors morph to light traces of chocolatey caramel that coat the mouth, and linger for a long time between sips. Balanced, flavorful, and unpretentious, the finish nicely encapsulates what this bourbon is all about.","Like the other bourbons produced from the A. Smith Bowman Distillery, John J. Bowman Single Barrel carries with it a unique background. If the rumors that this is made of distillate from Buffalo Trace’s mashbill #1 are true, it would share the same undertones as the E.H Taylor line and Eagle Rare. It also presents a great lesson in just how much aging factors into the taste of a bourbon.

In theory these distant cousins should be closer in flavor than they are. Instead the additional distillation and standalone aging in Virginia produces a bourbon that doesn’t exactly scream Buffalo Trace either. The end result isn’t one that really distinguishes itself from other single barrels on the market, but nevertheless still offers an enjoyable sip.","Priced at $50, John J. Bowman Single Barrel finds itself surrounded by some tough competition. Not only does it face off against Blanton’s and E.H Taylor Single Barrel, but also Four Roses Single Barrel and Knob Creek Single Barrel which cost slightly less. Each of these aforementioned bourbons offers a more memorable experience. That’s not to say that John J. Bowman Single Barrel presents a poor value. While it may not offer enough distinct characteristics to make it stand apart, it actually feels to be priced perfectly right in today’s marketplace.","With a unique background and pleasing flavor profile, John J. Bowman Single Barrel proves that it doesn’t matter how you start off in life, it’s all about how you finish.","John J. Bowman Single Barrel is certainly different from the company’s spicy Bowman Brothers Small Batch. However compared to other single barrel bourbons, it plays it straight down the middle of the road. Priced at a reasonable $50 and producing a pleasing classic bourbon profile, it’s hard to find many faults with this bourbon.

John J. Bowman is not overly unique, however it offers a fun distillation journey to contemplate while sipping on. And that ultimately is what’s great about the bourbon. Due to its hit or miss availability, it may not be a bourbon that you buy often. However when you do, you’re presented with a something that’s sure to satisfy any bourbon craving you have.

,Johnny Drum Private Stock Bourbon,Classification: Straight Bourbon,Company: Johnny Drum Distilling Company / Kentucky Bourbon Distillers (Willett),Distillery: Undisclosed,Released: Ongoing,Proof: 101,Age: NAS,Mashbill: Undisclosed,Color:  Medium Copper,MSRP: $35 (2017),Official Website,"According to the bottle’s label, Johnny Drum served as a drummer boy in the year 1861 during the Confederate (Civil) War. At the end of the war, legend has it Johnny returned home to his native Kentucky, where he staked claim among a beautiful spring. Johnny learned the importance of finding a way to convert his excess corn crop into a profitable item, rather than allowing it to go to waste. As the story goes, it wasn’t long before Johnny’s determination produced an exceptional bourbon whiskey.

Today, Johnny Drum is bottled in three forms (though only two are reflected on Willett’s website as of this writing) - Johnny Drum Private Stock, Johnny Drum Black Label, and Johnny Drum Green Label (not reflected). Owned by Willett, but bottled under the Johnny Drum Distilling Company name, it is a sourced bourbon of undisclosed origin.","Ethanol is assertive on the nose with hints of tobacco and caramel filtering through. Even sitting in the glass for a while, the ethanol seems to overpower whatever other aromas might be faintly present.","Loads of sweet caramel and vanilla break first, saturating the senses with a notable intensity that hugs the tongue. Bursts of tobacco and leather follow. A touch of smoky char along with a hint of custard round things out. The fusion of flavors on the palate is more rich than it is balanced, but what it offers is quite enjoyable.","It’s here that spice makes its first appearance. It’s warming and pronounced, but not specific. There’s also a touch of smokiness. Brown sugar sweetness develops and lingers, making for a medium-length, elegant finish.","The particular bottle of Johnny Drum sampled for this review was purchased a while ago, maybe even as much as 2-3 years. During that time I may have had it once or twice, as it went largely unnoticed gathering dust towards the back of my shelves. So the question becomes, now that I’ve gotten to know it better, does it stand out from the crowd?

While it no longer carries the 15 year age statement it once did quite some time ago, I can’t speak to the consistency of the non-age stated version of Johnny Drum Private Stock from batch to batch. The batches themselves are likely rather small, meaning consistency, or lack thereof, is a consideration. Moreover, the distillation source is unknown, so while Willett maintains control over the brand there is an additional layer of production they must contend with. Rumors suggest Heaven Hill as the source, and given the proximity to their distillery, the flavor profile, and quality of the bourbon it’s certainly believable.

Johnny Drum Private Stock offers a flavor profile that’s not overly unique in a general sense, but a more robust one than you might expect for the price. It’s proofed right at 101, and as a result what it lacks in balance, it makes up for in intensity.","Johnny Drum Private Stock isn’t a perfect bourbon by any means. The aromas on the nose are overpowered by ethanol and the sip is more intense than it is balanced. But considering its price point, it stands out. In fact, it’s becoming more difficult to find such deep intensity of flavors and character at the price point as age statements disappear and more producers push bourbons to market. This makes it worthy of your attention considering the crowded landscape of bourbons in the range, that, aside from their bottle and label designs, seem to be moving closer to center. So while the flavor profile itself isn’t overly unique, this bourbon is notably good for the price.","Johnny Drum Private Stock’s origin is a bit of a mystery, but that doesn’t overshadow the fact that it’s an intensely flavorful bourbon for a fair price.","I’ve owned this particular bottle of Johnny Drum Private Stock for a while now and rarely if ever reached for it before writing this review. In fact, it was almost full. Private Stock receives little fanfare, and reviews are scarce at best. While it once carried a 15 year age statement, it has long carried a NAS label among many others in the price range. With that, comes tapered expectations. However, despite Johnny Drum’s somewhat elusive background, it manages to distinguish itself from the crowd by offering a rich and robust flavor profile. While I’m curious how much it varies from batch to batch, I’ll be making this a regular in my bourbon drinking rotation and encourage anyone who hasn’t experienced it to seek out a bottle.",Nick,1.5,3.5,3,2.5,3,3,https://www.breakingbourbon.com/review/johnny-drum-private-stock-bourbon
,Kentucky Owl Confiscated,Classification: Straight Bourbon,Company: Stoli Group,Distillery: Sourced (from undisclosed distillery[ies] in Kentucky),Release Date: April 2019,Proof: 96.4,Age: NAS,Mashbill: Undisclosed,Color: Copper,Price: $125 (2019),Official Website,"Kentucky Owl Bourbon was founded in 1879 by C.M. Dedman and is currently led by Dixon Dedman. He recommissioned the brand and released his first batch of bourbon in 2014 and first batch of rye in 2017. The Kentucky Owl brand was purchased by the Stoli Group who plans to open up a new distillery under this brand name.

According to Kentucky Owl, “Confiscated pays tribute to the barrels the government seized from Dixon's great-great grandfather, C.M. Dedman, just ahead of Prohibition. Those barrels were never seen or tasted again. More than a century later, Confiscated is the first offering from Kentucky Owl that will be available in all 50 U.S. states.”","Hints of aged oak mingle with light caramel and leather. Delicate and understated, it’s interesting, and signals towards the whiskey being aged longer than I would have expected.","A nicely rounded mouthfeel delivers graham crackers, tobacco, and seasoned oak. The flavors are delicate here as they were in the nose, leaning away from sweeter flavors towards the savory side of the scale.","Slightly bitter, the finish turns towards a dry leather note at first. Cinnamon spice picks up later, bringing a satisfying pop of spice. Aged oak caps it off. It’s a long, complex, and surprisingly enjoyable finish.","While Confiscated doesn’t carry an age statement, the flavor profile suggests an higher age than I expected, with oak-forward characteristics. The bourbon also has dimension, with more complexity than average, and a finish that stands out.

But for me, when thinking about what makes a whiskey unique I always think about what’s beyond the glass. The process that goes into making bourbon is a large part of what makes it enjoyable to drink. Thinking about the recipe, the care it took to distill it, the year it was put into oak, where the barrel might have sat in the rickhouse. Maybe it’s released uncut and unfiltered giving drinkers a unique experience.

We don’t always know everything about the bourbon we drink, but in this case we know very little. Knowing simply that this bourbon was distilled in Kentucky and aged at least four years isn’t enough. The flavor profile is good suggesting experienced blending, but there's otherwise nothing provided to suggest anything else about this bourbon is unique.","A large part of my need for more background on this bourbon is driven by the price. If this was priced at $25, or even approached $50, it’s an easy buy based on taste. But it comes in much higher than that - $125. This whiskey has no distillery disclosure, no age statement, no mashbill disclosure, no details of sourcing or blending, and no details identifying something special about its creation. This makes its $125 price tag, quite literally, hard to swallow.

But looking at it from a different perspective Kentucky Owl is arguably smart to set the price high. If the market accepts it, then they set a bar for their brand proving that a widely distributed bourbon that simply bears the Kentucky Owl label, and nothing more, is worthy of an ultra premium price tag.

It's as if they've been working towards this since the first release.

Most previous releases saw low bottle counts, higher proofs, some age statements or at least details, and details about the whiskey's curation. They sold for a premium, which continued to increase with the previous bourbon, Batch 8, retailing for a whopping $300. These previous releases helped build an acceptable price point north of $100 for the brand.

Confiscated doesn't seem notably different than previous releases on first glance. To the unknowing consumer Confiscated looks no different. While it may be mass produced, widely distributed, and provide minimal details on what’s inside the bottle, many seeing it on the shelf won’t necessarily realize this.

But it’s not just about an age statement, proof, distribution, or bottle count. It’s about something. Anything. For $125, I want to know more about this bourbon than Kentucky Owl is telling us.","Confiscated is a well done bourbon with a flavor profile that suggests careful blending, though with little background to go by what may feel like a premium bourbon to some will most certainly feel overpriced to others.","While Confiscated tastes good, it's price just isn’t justified to the scrutinous consumer. But the average consumer likely won’t look deep enough to question it. It has a nice flavor profile bringing more depth and complexity than an average bourbon, but that's where it stops. In a way, I feel like I don't ""know"" this bourbon. More information about what’s in this bottle could bring me around to it. But until my questions are answered, I walk away seeing this simply as an overpriced bourbon that pushes the limits on what the market is willing to bear.

,Knob Creek Small Batch,Classification: Straight Bourbon,Company: Beam Suntory,Distillery: Jim Beam,Release Date: Ongoing,Proof: 100,Age: NAS,"Mashbill: 77% Corn, 13% Rye, 10% Malted Barley",Color: Bronze,MSRP: $35,Official Website,"Knob Creek Small Batch Bourbon is one of four bourbons that comprise Jim Beam’s Small Batch Bourbon Collection. The others are Basil Hayden’s, Baker’s Bourbon, and Booker’s Bourbon. Beam states that they “age every batch in maximum-char barrels to pull every bit of natural sweetness from the oak.” From its initial release in 1992 up to late 2016, Knob Creek carried a 9 year age statement. In 2016 Beam removed the age statement saying that they could not guarantee all barrels would be aged to 9 years due to inventory issues. Last year they announced the 9 year age statement will return in 2020.","Thick caramel, oak, lightly toasted marshmallows, and a hint of vanilla greet you. Knob Creek Small Batch manages to hide its proof well as very little ethanol is present. The classic scents are bold and rich, presenting a great way to start the sip.","Compared to the nose, the palate’s flavors aren’t as rich, and come across lighter. Those flavors that are present come across as sweeter overall. Sweet vanilla leads the way, followed by light oak, green peppercorns, a hint of caramel, and creme brulee. It's a nice combination, but leaves you wishing that it was just a tad bolder.","The finish is more one dimensional compared to the nose and palate. Aged oak and rye spice mingle with a touch of leather. While it may be one dimensional, it makes up for it in its length. These flavors stay for a while and ultimately leave you with a long lasting oaky spice that is a great way to end the sip.","Since Knob Creek’s initial release, small batch bourbons are more widespread. Most major distilleries have a small batch product, such as the popular Four Roses Small Batch or Elijah Craig Small Batch. While Knob Creek delivers its own unique flavor profile compared to others, it’s also not one that stands out head and shoulders above the competition - or at least as much as it used to.

Don’t get me wrong, there is little doubt that Knob Creek Small Batch doesn’t deliver a classic bourbon flavor profile. That said, there are two sides to the story of Knob Creek Small Batch. On one hand, it delivers an enjoyable pour that will be pleasing to most who try it. The flip side however, is that there is a lot of room for improvement too. Thankfully Beam has taken advantage of this opportunity and delivered some great Knob Creek variations such as the Single Barrel and Quarter Oak. These versions expand the foundation Knob Creek Small Batch laid and help derive a very unique impression from it.","The original king of small batch bourbon, Knob Creek has been a hard value to beat for the majority of its time on the market. Often found between $30-$35, Knob delivers a well-rounded flavor profile at a respectable 100 proof point. It’s lower price point allows new bourbon drinkers the chance to experience a higher proof bourbon than they may not have started off with, while still being able to deliver a great flavor-to-cost ratio for experienced bourbon drinkers as well.

In normal circumstances, this would be enough to secure a high value rating. The twist here, is that its own sibling, the fantastic Knob Creek Single Barrel variant, is usually only $10 more and delivers an even better value for the money. Additionally, while the small batch version lost its age statement for several years, you could often find a plentiful amount of single barrel selections that had a double-digit age statement. That said, even without an official age statement, the value of Knob Creek Small Batch is still a great deal for consumers.","As the original king of small batch bourbon, Knob Creek Small Batch continues to deliver a great flavor-to-price ratio for new and seasoned bourbon drinkers alike.","Knob Creek Small Batch contains all the classic traits you want out of a bourbon, and was the bourbon that helped define and push small batch bourbon to new levels. Sure it had some help from its lower proof sibling, Basil Hayden’s, along with its often forgotten higher proof brother, Baker’s Bourbon, however Knob Creek Small Batch’s 100 proof proved to be the sweet spot for consumers. Its proof plays well in a bold cocktail, yet also provides for a full-flavored sip when drinking it neat. Its flavor profile is classic yet enticing, and while Knob Creek Small Batch most likely won’t blow you away, it won’t disappoint either. With a very reasonable price tag, it’s hard not to recommend this as a staple to keep in anyone's bourbon collection.",Jordan,3.5,3,3,3,3,3,https://www.breakingbourbon.com/review/knob-creek-small-batch
,Knob Creek Small Batch 9 Year Bourbon,Classification: Straight Bourbon,Company: Beam Suntory,Distillery: Jim Beam,Release Date: Ongoing,Proof: 100,Age: 9 Years,"Mashbill: 75% Corn, 13% Rye, 12% Malted Barley",Color: Bronze,MSRP: $35 (2020),Official Website,"Knob Creek Small Batch Bourbon is one of four bourbons that comprise Jim Beam’s Small Batch Bourbon Collection.

Inhaling deeper presents notes of vanilla, light oak, and a dab of caramel. A hint of char and a dab of fresh marshmallows round things out. It’s an enjoyable way to start off the sip.","The pleasantness of the nose carries over to the palate. Rich oak builds a base, and is layered with green peppercorns, dabs of well balanced sweet vanilla, and lightly toasted caramel. It presents a lighter mouthfeel which is suiting to the overall lightness of the flavors present.

A lingering oak and warming spice help to round things out. It's a simple, yet enjoyable way to end, and helps cap off the sip nicely","As I’ve stated before, since Knob Creek’s initial release, small batch bourbons are more widespread. Most major distilleries have a small batch product, such as the popular Four Roses Small Batch or Elijah Craig Small Batch. While Knob Creek delivers its own unique flavor profile compared to others, it’s also not one that stands out head and shoulders above the competition - or at least as much as it used to.

Knob Creek Small Batch is built on a solid foundation of classic bourbon notes. Lately Beam has explored building on this base by playing with age variation in the form of the recent 12 Year and 15 Year Knob Creek Small Batch products. Compared to these products the Knob Creek Small Batch 9 Year seems to be lacking depth that more time in the barrel tends to bring out for this brand. These new releases don’t necessarily show that Knob Creek Small Batch 9 Year is an overly unique bourbon in and of itself, it instead shows what a brand can build off of with a solid foundation, which is exactly what Knob Creek Small Batch 9 Year is.","Even when it lost its age statement, Knob Creek Small Batch has always been a hard value to beat for the majority of its time on the market. Knob Creek delivers a well-rounded flavor profile at a respectable 100 proof all for only $35. Now with its 9 year age statement back, it presents the case for one of the highest valued bourbons on the market.

Its lower price point allows new bourbon drinkers the chance to experience a well-rounded age stated bourbon that is almost a decade old. Its 100 proof point is high enough to please those looking for a slightly stronger pour, while still being able to deliver a great manageable sip for those who may have started their bourbon journey at 80 proof and are looking to explore high proof ranges. Those same people might also have learned the value of an age statement, and Knob Creek 9 Year is a good next step for them. Some may argue that they can get a Knob single barrel pick for only $15 more, and while they’re often fantastic, not everyone is seeking out a 120 proof pour either. Knob Creek Small Batch offers a value proposition that is hard to beat in today’s marketplace.","Knob Creek Small Batch 9 Year may not be a bourbon you reach for every time, but it is a bourbon that deserves a staple spot in everyone's bourbon collection.","When I reviewed the NAS version of Knob Creek Small Batch earlier this year, I focused on the fact that small batch bourbons are more prevalent than they were when Knob Creek Small Batch was initially released. Not much has changed since that review, except for the fact that Knob Creek Small Batch has brought back its age statement.

Is this the best version of Knob Creek? Most certainly not. Is this the gateway version that hooks consumers into the Jim Beam Small Batch Collection or others who are looking to explore bourbons that are higher than 80 or 90 proof variants they might be used to? Absolutely. It’s hard to deny the flexibility this bourbon affords from its high proof cocktail abilities to its easy sipping nature. As a result, it’s worth exploring this brand if you haven’t yet.

While on its face the return of its age statement may seem like a big deal, however you have to take a step back to truly understand what this means. Sure it’s nice to see the return of an age statement to Knob Creek Small Batch, but the NAS version never really seemed to lose a step in its beat when it came to market. With the return of the age statement to Knob Creek Small Batch, the bourbon once again is steady eddie. Sure there's slight flavor profile differences between the two versions, but the overall sip is effectively the same: an above average bourbon that is easy to enjoy at a consumer friendly price point.",Jordan,3,3.5,3,3,4,3,https://www.breakingbourbon.com/review/knob-creek-small-batch-9-year-bourbon
,Knob Creek Twice Barreled Rye,Classification: Straight Rye,Company: Beam Suntory,Distillery: Jim Beam,Release Date: November 2018,Proof: 100,Age: NAS,Mashbill: Undisclosed (Knob Creek Rye is believe to be at or just slightly above the legal minimum of 51% rye),Color: Bronze,MSRP: $45 (2019),Official Website,"Knob Creek Twice Barreled Rye is a limited release by Beam. Twice Barreled Rye is the standard Knob Creek Rye, secondarily finished in new, level 4 charred oak barrels.","Oak, rye grain, and baked oats are at the forefront. Lingering behind are hay, muted vanilla, and sweet sugar scents. A layer of ethanol is present bringing a noticeable overlay of heat to the nose. The effect allows the nose to be nicely balanced, though slightly hot for the proof.","Rye spice, vanilla, and smoky oak quickly appear with white pepper and light anise hiding in the background. The double barrel effect is in full play in the palate as a noticeable underlying level of sweetness is present. This doesn’t come as a surprise as a deeply charred second barrel typically delivers this effect. While the nose may have shown some heat, the palate is an easy sip and readily allows you to roll it around your mouth to dissect the flavors. It adds a nice twist to your average rye experience.","The sweet sugars carry through to the finish and combine with a low simmering heat that is present throughout. Sweet vanilla and oak kick things off and quickly fade to a drier leathery oak combo that lingers for a while. It’s not your traditional rye finish, but in line with the rest of the sip, albeit delivering a slightly weaker experience than the nose and palate.","Knob Creek Twice Barreled Rye is definitely sweeter than your normal rye experience. The sweetness however doesn’t come across as fruity as what I’ve found in other sweeter ryes like Rittenhouse Rye Bottled in Bond or Pinhook Bourbon n Rye. Instead, the sweetness comes across from the double barrel process, which for a rye, is rarely if ever seen.

Beam knew exactly what they were doing when using a heavier level 4 char for the second barrel. This sweetness adds a nice contrasting play with the rye grain, and delivers an end result that is certainly interesting. It’s not the most unique tasting rye I’ve ever tasted, however it does bring a certain newness to the rye category from those extra sugary flavors delivered by the double barrel process.","In theory, $45 for a limited release is about as good as it gets nowadays. Outside of Beam, there aren’t too many major distilleries pricing their limited editions this inexpensively, with perhaps Barton 1792’s recent limited releases readily coming to mind. Whereas the recent 2018 Knob Creek Cask Strength Rye was priced at double the cost of a regular Knob Creek Rye, Twice Barreled Rye is only $10-$15 more.

That said, a low price alone doesn’t necessarily deliver a great value either. The flavors, while unique, are also not your typical rye flavors, which may turn some people off. For the price, I was expecting a more intricate play between the spice and sweetness found in the sip. At $45 it’s priced where it should be, but I wouldn’t recommend paying more than MSRP for this release either.","A rye with a sweet twist, Knob Creek Twice Barreled Rye brings double barreled ryes mainstream.","Knob Creek Twice Barreled Rye won’t blow anyone away. What it will do though, is deliver a new experience for rye drinkers who are looking for something new and unique. It doesn’t deliver a typical spicy flavor profile, and that’s okay in this case. Its sweeter flavor profile presumably originating from the double barrel finishing process plays nicely with the rye spice that is noticeable and delivers an easy sipping rye. Add in a reasonable price and it’s a bottle that most rye drinkers probably won’t regret picking up to try.",Jordan,3,3,2.5,3,2.5,3,https://www.breakingbourbon.com/review/knob-creek-twice-barreled-rye
,Lost Prophet Bourbon,Classification: Straight Bourbon,Company: Diageo/Orphan Barrel Whiskey Distilling Co.,Distillery: George T. Stagg Distillery,Released: December 2014,Proof: 90.1,Age: 22 Years,"Mashbill: 75-78% corn, 15% rye, 7-10% malted barley",Color:  Deep Copper,MSRP: $120,Official Website,"Lost Prophet was distilled in the old George T. Stagg Distillery (which is now Buffalo Trace), matured in the old Stitzel-Weller warehouses in Louisville, KY, and was bottled in Tullahoma, TN at the George Dickel distillery. The reported mash bill is: 75-78% corn; 15% rye; 7-10% malted barley, which closely resembles Buffalo Trace’s high rye #2 mash bill that Ancient Age, Elmer T. Lee, and Blanton’s use. This will be a one-time release. Review bottle #16,306.","There’s a good amount of oak upfront that’s cut with a nice amount of honey, cherry, maple, and cinnamon buns. No one element overpowers the others. Its nose is not overly deep, but it does have a few layers that add a bit of complexity to it. There’s the hint of an amazing nose within that doesn’t quite follow all the way through. I can’t help but wonder how amazing the nose could be at a higher proof.","No doubt about it, this has a very oak-forward palate. At 22 years old that is to be expected, but thankfully, it doesn’t suffocate the rest of the flavors. Notes of clove, cinnamon, and honey mingle in. Surprisingly, the palate doesn't taste muted as a result from the large amount of oak present, but more watered down because of the proof. There’s some good flavor on the palate (like many of the Orphan Barrels have), but at 90.1 proof, the flavors have a hard time standing out. You can taste that Lost Prophet’s palate has potential, which is all the more heartbreaking when it ultimately falls short.","It has a dry finish that lingers and a slight tinge of burn as it goes down. The dryness stays with you, but not to the degree the saliva-sucking Rhetoric did. The flavors blend a bit on the finish and become muddled leaving a slight tannic aftertaste. It’s not a bad finish, but on the unspectacular side.","One the most prominent themes of the Orphan Barrel line are their high age statements. Few bourbons hit the market in any year that hover around 20 years old. It’s said bourbon hits its sweet spot between 9-12 years, which is one reason we don’t see many high-aged bourbons. The bottles that do hit are more often strikes outs than home runs. Elijah Craig 22 Year and 2013’s Eagle Rare 17 Year (really 19 years old) have been the only recent high-aged standouts for me. The first Orphan Barrel release Barterhouse, had a respectable showing last year that I don’t think gets the acclaim that it deserves.

As for Lost Prophet, it’s a better-balanced high-aged bourbon, but the search for the crown jewel of the Orphan Barrel line continues. The oak notes are definitely more restrained than other high-aged bourbons. This gives the other flavors in Lost Prophet a chance to shine, but unfortunately they just don’t. This is by no means a bad bourbon though, it’s quite decent. You can taste the potential promise of great flavors, yet they are never quite as vivid as they should be. Simply not drowning out the palate’s flavors with oak for a high-aged bourbon is to be commended, but that’s only half the story. The follow-through is just as important.","A bourbon needs to be more than decent for it to be worth $120, regardless of its age. Bourbons that cost north of $100 are rarely worth the money, and Lost Prophet is sadly yet another example of this. One of the main criticisms of the Orphan Barrel series is its proof point. The low 90.1 proof does the flavors a disservice. That said, there is certainly no guarantee that a higher proof would instantly make Lost Prophet better; it could even enhance the intensity of the oak flavor and completely drown out the other flavors. The odd thing about all of the bourbons in the Orphan Barrel line is the flavors all taste somewhat muted. There are many 90 proof bottles and even high-aged bottles on the market that have a much fuller flavor than this. Maybe it’s over-filtering that is the cause. If a company is going to charge this much for a bottle of bourbon then it must bring it’s “A” game. As the fourth bottle in the Orphan Barrel series, this has to be true more than ever. Yet again, I’m let down by an expensive, under-flavored bourbon.","At 22 years old it manages its oak flavors better than most high-aged bourbons, but its other flavors just don’t shine bright enough.","You can taste the potential in every bottle of the Orphan Barrel line and Lost Prophet is no exception. The problem is its great flavor only shows itself in a ghostly form; it’s present, yet not. Lost Prophet is a good value for a 22-year-old bourbon if age is the only thing you care about. Compared to its peers, it better balances its oak flavor than 2014’s Eagle Rare 17 Year and Elijah Craig 23 Year. Flavor-wise, it can’t compete with 2013’s Eagle Rare 17 Year, Elijah Craig 22 Year, and even the 20-year-old Orphan Barrel Barterhouse. Having a decent flavor palate that’s better balanced with the oak isn’t enough to justify Lost Prophet’s price. A premium price often brings with it premium expectations. After three ho-hum Orphan Barrel releases, it’s hard to expect a home run with Lost Prophet going into it. Sure it isn’t a complete strike out, but when you’re paying this much money, you expect a better performance.",Eric,3.5,3,2.5,2.5,2.5,3,https://www.breakingbourbon.com/review/lost-prophet-bourbon
,Maker's 46 Bourbon,Classification: Bourbon,Company: Beam Suntory,Distillery: Maker's Mark,Released: Ongoing,Proof: 94,Age: NAS (Around 6 years),"Mashbill: 70% Corn, 16% Wheat, 14% Malted Barely",Color:  Dark Toffee,MSRP: $40 (2017),Official Website,"Maker's 46 starts off as standard Maker’s Mark, which is a wheated bourbon made in batches of less than 1,000 gallons. Then, heavily seared French oak staves are placed in just-emptied standard Maker's Mark barrels, which are then refilled and returned to the warehouses to finish aging for an undisclosed amount of time (estimated to be 2-3 additional months).","Upon lifting the glass I am greeted with the familiar Maker's profile, but with a twist. Maker's 46 nose comes across as slightly heavier and deeper than what I’m used to from the distillery. All of the classic bourbon flavors are present, including strong hints of caramel, toasted oak, and vanilla, along with buttery toffee and a touch of fresh toasted cinnamon bread. Really pleasant with a nice amount of depth to enjoy.","The first thought that pops into my head upon tasting Maker's 46 is a kitchen on a Sunday morning. A nice buttery palate presents heavy oak, caramel, cinnamon, and light fresh baked wheat bread. The palate’s flavors aren’t as deep as the nose, however it’s very well balanced and really enjoyable.","A blast of spice containing buttered rum, hints of tobacco and leather, and aged oak all greet me on the finish. It seems to liven up from the palate and presents more discernable flavor right up front. That being said, while it lingers for a while, it becomes more one dimensional, consisting mainly of light hints of tobacco and leather. Not bad, however I was hoping it would last a little bit longer since it starts off very enjoyable.","Maker’s Mark should be given credit for what they’ve done with Maker's 46. The bourbon clearly contains the soul of their standard Maker’s Mark while enhancing it in an overall positive way. While the exposure to additional charred wood has given Maker's 46 a woodier flavor profile, it’s not one that’s overly oaked, and brings with it a nice blast of sweetness from the additional sugars from the seared French oak staves. Maker’s 46 brings takes that beloved Maker’s Mark flavor profile and amplifies it in all the right ways through a very unique twist on barrel finishing not seen elsewhere in the industry.","Maker's 46 sells for 33% more than the cost of a standard Maker’s Mark. While this may feel steep, you also have to take into account that a 33% increase is only $10 more. Do I feel like you get your money’s worth with Maker's 46 versus Maker’s Mark and other easily available wheated bourbons? For me, the answer is absolutely. Maker’s 46 presents a really great, rich flavor profile that you don’t often see in wheated bourbons, and one that I wish the standard Maker’s Mark contained. If you’re a fan of standard Maker’s and can swing the $10 price premium, then this is a no brainer in my book.","It’s not earth-shattering bourbon, however it levels up one of the most iconic bourbon brands on the planet to a really enjoyable level.","I’m normally not the biggest Maker’s Mark fan, so I went into this tasting a little skeptical. While the bourbon definitely starts strongest in the nose and fades from there, Maker’s 46 still left me pleasantly surprised. Everything about Maker’s 46 seems to be more refined than the standard Maker's. From the more sophisticated looking bottle, one that breaks away from the iconic square influence of regular Maker’s, to the flavor profile, which is all around an enhancement of the standard Maker’s Mark profile.

It should be noted however, that individuals who love the flavor profile of Maker's Mark may be turned off by this enhanced fuller finish. That being said, while I may not stock my bar with Maker’s Mark, I would gladly buy another bottle of Maker’s 46.",Jordan,3.5,3,2.5,3.5,3,3,https://www.breakingbourbon.com/review/makers-46-bourbon
,Michter's Toasted Finish Bourbon,Classification: Bourbon,"Company: Chatham Imports, Inc",Distillery: Kentuck Bourbon Distillers,Released: October 2014,Proof: 91.4,Age: NAS,Mashbill: Undisclosed,Color:  Light Amber,MSRP: $50,Official Website,"Michter’s Batch Number 14I539. Willy Pratt of Michter’s has stated that this is the company's Regular US*1 Bourbon that was finished in a brand-new toasted white oak barrel that has been toasted over an open flame of its own wood for 60 minutes. Michter’s regular US*1 bourbon was then aged 26 days in this new barrel. This was determined through trial and error, as the company realized that 10 days wasn’t enough time in the new toasted barrel and that 30 days was too much additional aging time, thus they settled on 26 days.","Light wood, fresh dough, fresh washed mushrooms and a hint of smoke are all present. It reminded me of inhaling a fresh uncooked pizza about to go into a wood fired oven. Compared to the normal Michter’s US*1 Bourbon, the nose is much more prominent. The nose was so strong, that the moment I poured this bourbon into my glass sitting on the table I could smell it.","Honey, vanilla and light caramel jumped out at me with a subtle hint of smoke quickly appearing as I took that first sip. While not as sweet as their normal bourbon, it’s a very pleasant palate that seems a bit more refined than what you find in a sip of regular Michter’s US*1 Bourbon.","Surprisingly a strong sense of smoked wood was very present at the start of this finish, which reminded me of a light scotch in a sense. The smoke faded away and turned into aged oak, leather, and light traces of pepper, which ramped up in heat the longer the finish went on. Unlike the regular Michter’s US*1 Bourbon, this finish seemed to linger in my mouth for a while which was a really pleasant surprise.","While I find the normal Michter’s US*1 Bourbon tastes like it hasn’t spent much time in the barrel, the additional 26 days in a toasted oak barrel made a world of difference to this bourbon. I was really surprised at how much of a smoky overall flavor profile this bourbon took on. While other distillers have finished their bourbon in either new charred oak barrels (Woodford Double Oaked) or in used wine barrels (High West, Heaven Hill, etc.), this is the first time I can recall a bourbon being barreled in a toasted barrel. Unlike normal charred oak barrels that are exposed to high heat for a short burst of time of a minute or less, these barrels were exposed to heat via the burning of the same wood that comprised the staves on the barrel itself. This unique long exposure to a lower heat really imparted a nice flavor profile on this bourbon.","This bourbon is priced at a premium of $50 which is usually the going rate for a barrel finished bourbon these days, no matter the distiller. That being said, I find the normal Michter’s at $40 to be overpriced by about $15. While good, I still have the same feelings on this Toasted Barrel Finish release and feel this is more in line with a $40 Bourbon.

It’s a fine bourbon, and certainly better than the normal Michter’s. However, if I were to spend $50 on a bottle of bourbon, I’d sooner recommend a bottle of Blanton’s for the same price or Elijah Craig 12 or Four Roses Single Barrel for much less. This is especially true when you consider Michter’s sources their bourbon and gives very little information of the origin of what you’re drinking.",A really interesting bourbon that tends to stand out from the rest in a crowded marketplace of barrel finished bourbons.,"This toasted barrel surprised me on many fronts. Coming into this review I was expecting a lot of wood to be present in this bourbon. Instead, I was surprised at how much smoke was imparted into this bourbon from the toasting of the second barrel it was finished in. Additionally I was surprised at how much it transformed the normally young tasting Regular Michter’s US*1 Bourbon into a bourbon that tastes like it sat in the barrel for another year or two. The toasted finish definitely imparted a much more rounded flavor profile to this bourbon which makes it very drinkable.

While I still feel this is slightly overpriced for what it is, I would certainly recommend the toasted barrel finish version over the regular version of Michter’s US*1 Bourbon any day.",Jordan,3,2.5,3,4.5,2,3,https://www.breakingbourbon.com/review/michters-toasted-finish-bourbon
,Minor Case Rye - Sherry Cask Finished - 2017,Classification: Straight Rye Finished in Sherry Casks,Company: Limestone Branch Distillery Co.,"Distillery: MGP Ingredients, Inc.",Released: February 2017 / Ongoing Annual Release,Proof: 90,Age: 2 Years,"Mashbill: 51% Rye, 45% Corn, 4% Malted Barley",Color:  Light Amber,MSRP: $50 (2018),Official Website,"Limestone Branch Distillery introduced Minor Case Rye in February, 2017. The whiskey was inspired by Limestone Branch founders Steve and Paul Beam’s great-grandfather, Minor Case Beam. Minor Case Beam operated a distillery prior to prohibition, but passed away shortly after it’s repeal. He made rye whiskey during his pre-prohibition days, and it was his specialty. This rye was inspired by him and meant to pay tribute to his distilling legacy. Incidentally, this whiskey’s mashbill shares the same 51% rye component as Beam family recipes dating back to the 1930s.

Distilled and aged at MGP in Indiana, this 2 year old straight rye has been aged for additional time by Limestone Branch in Sherry casks from Meier’s Winery, which held their award winning #44 Cream Sherry. According to Steve Beam, the finishing period is a mix of ages ranging from a very short time to about 8 months so that the same flavor profile can be recreated each year.","The aroma is soft on entry, but there’s a lot going on. Sweet summer fruits, floral notes, and a hint of rye spice are most prominent. It has a familiar MGP rye nose, but with additional complexity brought by the fruit and floral notes. It’s enjoyable and well developed.","Like the aromas the sip is also soft on entry, with cherry, raisin, and caramelized sugary notes first. A touch of rye spice along with an almost port-like flavor round out the backend. Being a finished rye, the sherry cask finish seems to become more evident here. It’s gentle and easy to drink, with a well-rounded and nicely integrated flavor profile.","A little pop of spice starts things off, followed by a reinvigoration of the sweet fruit and sugary notes found in the palate. The sweetness lingers, but it’s soft and subtle right until the end. Overall it’s quite good.","Minor Case Rye is a very soft, easy to sip whiskey. It’s layered and nuanced but very subtle at the same time, much like the experience I find with Hillrock Estate’s Solera Aged Bourbon. At two years old, it’s quite young but that youth is well hidden by its flavor profile. It’s a trend I’m starting to notice more and more with two year old ryes, as many just don’t taste anywhere near as young as I’d expect. Based on tasting, my assumption is the sherry cask finishing not only mellows out this whiskey’s rough edges, but adds additional depth to the flavor profile as well.

Barrel finishing, including sherry cask finishing, is becoming increasingly popular. I haven’t had every sherry finished bourbon or rye, and did not have any sherry cask finished ryes available in-hand to directly compare. But direct comparisons aside, compared to rye whiskey at large Minor Case Rye does succeed in separating itself from the herd, offering a more layered and softer drinking experience than you’d typically find.","Simply talking technicals, at only two years the age will surely put up red flags for some people. But that aside, additional time in sherry casks combined with what I can only assume was a combination of quality craftsmanship and highly skilled tasters, the final product is a good one. I’m also a sucker for fanciful bottles, and the extra care put into this one helps make it feel premium, even if it doesn’t make the whiskey taste any different. To that end, at $50 it’s not a bargain whiskey, but a bit of a splurge. It will probably surprise most at how complex and well integrated it is, especially considering its age. Don’t expect a flavor bomb, but if you’re looking for something that’s subtle and a little different from much of what might be on your shelves, Minor Case Rye delivers. If you’re looking for a plain old bargain whiskey or still exploring new flavor profiles in the “everyday” whiskey area, I’d recommend putting your resources there instead.",Minor Case Rye offers a soft yet complex and well integrated whiskey that will surprise you at how well developed it is...especially considering its age.,"Having experience with just about all of the readily-available always-on-the-shelf bourbons and ryes, I’m finding myself gravitate more towards those whiskeys that are a little different and maybe not so readily available when I see them. Minor Case Rye is a subtle whiskey, which takes a little more of my undivided attention to appreciate the nuances it offers. At $50, it’s certainly above the “just buy it” range, but remains inside the territory that most are probably willing to spend. To that end, it’s certainly an “am I ready for this yet?” type of whiskey - one that will be right for someone who can appreciate a more subtle and outside the box flavor profile.If you’re still exploring the basics, I would say keep exploring, as you probably won’t appreciate this yet and it won’t be money well spent. However, if you’re wanting to get into new things, and appreciate subtle whiskeys, then this might be for you. As my whiskey assortment grows I do find that Minor Case Rye adds something to it, filling a gap in flavor profile that others in my collection just don’t have, even if it is subtle and nuanced in its delivery.",Nick,3,3.5,3,3,2.5,3,https://www.breakingbourbon.com/review/minor-case-rye-sherry-cask-finished-2017
,New Riff Kentucky Straight Rye,Classification: Straight Rye,Company: New Riff Distilling,Distillery: New Riff Distilling,Release Date: Ongoing,Proof: 100,Age: NAS (Aged at least 4 years),"Mashbill: 95% Rye, 5% Malted Rye",Color: Copper,MSRP: $45,Official Website,"Ken Lewis opened New Riff Distillery in the spring of 2014 in Newport, Kentucky, which is just on the other side of the river from Cincinnati. While New Riff built up the supply of their own aged products, they sourced high-rye bourbon from MGP. They named this brand O.K.I. which stands for: Ohio, Kentucky, Indiana, aka distilled in Indiana, bottled in Kentucky, and loved in Ohio. This  brand has now been retired and New Riff is focused on their own distillate.

The sourcing of products was necessary to buy the company time, since New Riff wanted to age their products in 53 gallon barrels and release them as Bottled in Bond products. Additionally, New Riff products are currently being released without chill filtration.

This bottle being reviewed is their own distillate. It was distilled in the spring of 2015 and bottled in the spring of 2019. It’s Bottled in Bond, without chill filtration, and according to the company’s website, aged at least four years.","Surprisingly smokey, the nose starts with charred oak, flamed orange peel, oats, and the faintest hints of vanilla and burnt caramel. These aromas all mingle with an underlying sense of smokieness and a light layer of ethanol. It’s a fantastic start to the sip, drawing you in and making you wonder if it’ll taste as unique as it smells.","The whiskey has a light and silky mouthfeel, yet one that still delivers plenty of flavor. Spicy and sweet, with orange zest, black pepper, tobacco leaf, and touches of honey and vanilla are also noticeable. Rye spice comes in large waves as I swirl the sip around my mouth.","A hot fiery finish ends the sip. Bold rye spice and a peppery blast are found at the start. This spiciness lingers and is mixed in with a pleasing amount of heat. Though enjoyable, the finish isn’t as diverse as the nose and palate, and also carries a hint of youth to it. These factors make it come off as the weaker part of the overall sip in comparison.","New Riff takes a refreshingly new approach with their product. It seems like they distinctly tried to merge old tradition with new ways of  bringing this product to market. While not the first distillery to wait until their own distillate was aged the required four years and could be released as Bottled in Bond - Wilderness Trail also went this route - New Riff is part of the small club to do so, and does so with all of their current standard whiskey products. Additionally, the fact that they chose to do no chill filtration will appeal to many in the whiskey community. Top all of this off with a well designed embossed glass bottle and a sleek black synthetic cork, and New Riff Rye stands out from the crowd.

Package design and distillation choices only go so far however. In the end it’s what’s in the bottle that counts. In this case, New Riff delivers a solid contender. With little youth present in the sip, it delivers flavor profile that is easy to enjoy and full of depth. It’s not quite as well rounded as say Pikesville Rye 6 Year, however it’s spicy bold flavor profile helps it stand out from the pack of its rye competitors.","Coming in at $45 seems like a great bargain nowadays for a full flavored whiskey. That is until you realize that rye, with a few exceptions, isn’t as crazy as the bourbon is in the market. While $45 is relatively inexpensive in the grand comparison of the whiskey world, it still puts New Riff Rye at the higher end of our Best Rye Whiskeys list. Its unique traits from a technical standpoint don’t carry over to help here either, as New Riff Rye isn’t the only Bottled in Bond rye on the market. The long standing crowd favorite Rittenhouse Rye Bottled in Bond, can be had with little effort and at only two-thirds of the price.

For a newer distillery however, the price is a nice start. Usually with a young upstart like New Riff, you have an outrageous price tag that makes you second guess buying a bottle from an unproven distillery. New Riff helps break that mold though and even with a $45 price tag, delivers a well-rounded, fair-valued rye.","New Riff’s first in-house rye is a bold entrance to the market that delivers a spicy sip that makes you pause to wonder, just what the future and additional aging time will bring to this company’s impressive distillate.","Based on what I’ve tasted so far from New Riff, I’m excited to see where the company goes. With a little more time in the barrel, their aged ryes may hold their own against the best. In the meantime, New Riff Rye is a solid first showing for the company’s own rye distillate. Yes, it has its misses, the finish in particular, but overall this is an all around, good nuanced pour. It delivers a bold spicy flavor profile that is sure to please many rye lovers, all while doing so as a Bottled in Bond rye with no chill filtration, which is sure to please students of whiskey alike.",Jordan,3.5,3,2.5,3.5,2.5,3,https://www.breakingbourbon.com/review/new-riff-kentucky-straight-rye
,Old Blowhard Bourbon,Classification: Bourbon,Company: Diageo/Orphan Barrel Distilling Co.,Distillery: Bernheim,Released: March 2014,Proof: 90,Age: 26 Years,"Mashbill: 86% Corn, 8% Malted Barley, 6% Rye",Color:  Dark Copper,MSRP: $150 (2014),Official Website,,"Leather, oak, raisin, orange rind, burnt sugar, dried cherries, a hint of dark chocolate. Overall, it's a sweet and pleasant smelling bourbon. The oak and leather surprisingly doesn’t overpower the nose and while vanilla is present, the different fruit scents overlap it in a good way.",Not as sweet as the nose suggests. The oak flavor is the most dominant trait but it doesn’t completely overpower the bourbon. Small amounts of dried cherries and hints of dark chocolate peek through the oak. The palate is overall light and airs more on a balanced array of flavors than hitting you with a mouthful of any one flavor. Overall the flavors are very unobtrusive.,The high age and strong (but not overbearing) oak flavors leave the bourbon with a dry finish. The medium to light finish has a flash of spice before it dissipates all too soon. This once again probably has more to do with the Orphan Barrel line’s lower-than-average proof point than the bourbon itself. Although this one doesn't taste as watered down as Barterhouse did.,"The best thing the Orphan Barrel bourbons have going for them (beside the packaging), are their deliciously sweet smelling noses. Each one in the line has its own distinct style, and they are all great. The problem is the rest of the experience. The bourbon itself just falls short. They’re not bad, but they’re not great either. Old Blowhard’s palate is interesting and has its own unique taste, but there’s just something missing. Years ago when Parker Heritage released a 27 year bourbon they nailed it. It’s full bodied and has a great balance of flavors with just the right amount of oak. Five years later, there’s still nothing like it. I doubt anyone will say that five years from now about Old Blowhard.","It’s very hard to age a bourbon 26 years and do it right. But that is Diageo’s problem, not mine. In the case of the Parker’s 27 year bourbon, it’s a perfect example of a bourbon worth its premium price. Old Blowhard at $150 may be a decent value for its age, but not for the bourbon inside the bottle. I might be ok paying half that based on Old Blowhard’s quality. Whenever anyone releases a product, you judge the product on its own merits, but you undoubtedly have to compare it to other like products in the marketplace. At over double the price of Buffalo Trace Antique Collection, which is the true benchmark of premium bourbon and great value, Old Blowhard doesn’t come close.",Further disappointment from a line I had a lot of excitement for.,"The current Orphan Barrel line really wants to be great bourbon, but no matter how hard they may try, it's just not going to be. All of the bourbons seem to have a good foundation and are just-above-average in uniqueness, but yet they keep coming up short. Once bourbon starts to go bad during aging, you can’t magically make it better (blending aside). Diageo must have finally got to the point where they had to do something with their massive collection of random barrels from old distilleries. So then, why not slap some amazing labels on trendy shaped bottles with some snazzy marketing to help drum up excitement? The juice quality wasn’t going to sell itself. They had no choice but to rely on the marketing do that job. Again, I don’t think Old Blowhard and the rest of the Orphan Barrel line are bad bourbons, they're just not fantastic and worth their MSRP.",Eric,3.5,3,3,3,1.5,3,https://www.breakingbourbon.com/review/old-blowhard-bourbon
,Old Elk Blended Straight Bourbon,Classification: Blended Straight Bourbon,Company: Old Elk Distillery,Distillery: Three distilleries - MGP in Indiana and undisclosed distilleries in New York and Colorado,Release Date: Ongoing,Proof: 88,Age: 4 Years,"Mashbill: 51% Corn, 34% Malted Barley, 15% Rye",Color: Medium Amber,MSRP: $50 (2019),Official Website,"Old Elk Distillery was founded by Curt Richardson, also the visionary behind Otterbox. Joined by Greg Metze, former master distiller at MGP in Indiana, the company is currently in the final stages of opening a 35,000 square foot distillery and aging warehouse in Fort Collins, Colorado targeted for completion at the end of 2019. Their flagship product, Old Elk Bourbon, currently originates from three different distilleries located in Indiana, New York , and Colorado, but is intended to be produced exclusively by Old Elk Distillery in the future. A proprietary “Slow Cut” proofing process is used, whereby proofing water is added over a period of several weeks or more as compared with a more typical proofing process of only 24-48 hours. The intent of this process is to preserve the congeners present in the bourbon. The bottle in review carries a four year age statement, while some earlier releases do not.","Light with traces of cinnamon and cocoa which layer against traditional notes of caramel and burnt oak. While the scents are nice, they’re very delicate necessitating a good hard inhale to eke them out.","The sip enters gently and the first thing I notice is its velvety mouthfeel. It’s quite easy to roll around in the mouth with almost no burn, and it takes a few moments for the flavors to develop. An ever-so-light cinnamon spice comes into play, along with brown sugar, cocoa, and maple syrup. It’s very approachable, with a contrasting viscous, velvety mouthfeel against a modest set of flavors.","The flavors crescendo, with a brief eruption of baking spice and chocolatey caramel notes. The mild intensity quickly dissipates, leaving traces of brown sugar and maple syrup sweetness against rye spice.","On the surface Old Elk might seem like just another premium priced bourbon in an elegant bottle. But digging deeper there are some interesting things about this bourbon that require a little more exploration or knowledge about the industry.

The most prominent is the name scribed on the front label - Greg Metze. A veteran master distiller, Metze may just be one of today’s most prominent distillers you’ve rarely heard of. Former master distiller at MGP - the Indiana distillery behind many sourced brands along with their well-known 95% rye - Metze resigned from his role there in 2016 to venture into the bourbon consulting business. He now works exclusively with Old Elk Distillery.

When Old Elk approached Metze about five years ago, the goal was to create a “smooth and easy bourbon,” according to Metze. To accomplish this he lowered the corn content to the minimum 51% allowable for bourbon in order to make room for 34% malted barley providing sweet smooth characteristics, and 15% rye for some spice notes. At 34%, this is an unusually high amount of malted barley for a bourbon.    

Old Elk has been distilled with the custom mashbill and aged in three different states before being blended and bottled in Colorado. Metze developed and produced the custom Old Elk mashbill, along with four other custom mashbills currently aging, for Old Elk during his time as master distiller at MGP in Indiana. The custom Old Elk Bourbon mashbill was subsequently produced at New York and Colorado distilleries. Each bourbon in the blend is a straight bourbon, and the reason the label states “blended” straight bourbon is strictly because of this, as Metze confirmed it would qualify as straight bourbon if not for the multi-state sources. But this was always only a temporary strategy to build enough stock early on, and the initial production run is now complete. As a result the existing bourbon stock continues to age, and as of November 2018 all of the inventory reached a minimum of four years old. Old Elk currently has the ability to mash, ferment, distill, and age at their distillery, and as of the end of this year their distillery and warehouse located in Fort Collins, Colorado are scheduled to be completed.

Finally, there is one thing about this bourbon that really stood out to me. The marketing and conversations with Metze consistently use one word - smooth. While some critics cringe at the use of the word when describing bourbon, it is one that comes up often. We get requests on a regular basis from folks looking for “smooth” bourbons. Admittedly, the first word that came to mind when I sipped this was “smooth,” and yes we joked about it. But there is something different about this bourbon, and it’s very subtle. I think this is attributed to the “Slow Cut” proofing process they use, which is a unique and proprietary one. While proofing is typically a 24-48 hour process, Old Elk’s process takes several weeks longer. The benefit is it preserves the more delicate congeners produced during fermentation, distillation, and maturation. According to Metze, “when reduction water is added to barrel proof distillates, heat is liberated and can drive off high volatility congeners. By doing the reduction in many stages, rather than one or two, the amount of heat liberated is incrementally less, thus protecting the congener profile.”","Old Elk Bourbon is carefully crafted and intended to be a smooth bourbon with mass appeal. The company succeeds in that goal. At $50 it is premium priced, and its 88 proof won’t necessarily excite more die-hard enthusiasts. But this is a premium bourbon intended for the masses. If there were a direct competitor the one that comes to mind is Basil Hayden’s - a premium easy-sipping bourbon with mass appeal. When comparing taste, Old Elk blows it out of the water. It’s far more satisfying, and my hunch is more carefully crafted. As someone who scrutinizes bourbons on a regular basis, I actually found myself enjoying this, and will recommend it without hesitation every time someone asks me for a “smooth” sipping bourbon.","A carefully crafted premium bourbon directed towards the masses, Old Elk is a smooth, easy-sipping bourbon with an interesting backstory.","This bourbon really surprised me. I noticed its velvety mouthfeel and straightforward flavor profile right away, and immediately it struck me as a bourbon with qualities that would lend to mass appeal. While I find the flavor a bit subdued at 88 proof, I have to remind myself that I can sip a 140 proof bourbon without hesitation. Even then, I found myself enjoying it. The fact is, this is intended to be sipped neat by the masses, and it succeeds in being a bourbon with the appeal to meet that goal.

,Old Ezra 7 Year 101 Proof,Classification: Straight Bourbon,Company: Luxco,Distillery: Sourced (from undisclosed distillery[ies] in Kentucky),Release Date: Discontinued,Proof: 101,Age: 7 Years,Mashbill: Undisclosed (High rye mashbill),Color: Caramel,Price: $25 (2020),Official Website,"The Luxco bourbon portfolio consists of Rebel Yell, Ezra Brooks, Yellowstone, David Nicholson, Blood Oath, and Lux Row Distillers Double Barrel Bourbon. The company has largely been a non-distiller producer and is thought to have sourced their bourbon from Heaven Hill. In 2018, they completed construction of their own distillery in Bardstown, Kentucky on the Kentucky Bourbon Trail. According to the company, Lux Row Distillery features 18,000 square feet, six barrel warehouses and a 43-foot custom copper still. They are capable of producing 3 million gallons of spirit per year. When fully complete they’ll have the ability to process 50 thousand barrels of whiskey annually, and their own distillate will replace their sourced whiskey when it comes of age.

Old Ezra 101 Proof was officially discontinued by Luxco when they introduced Old Ezra Barrel Strength in 2018. The company points to David Nicholson Reserve Bourbon as a replacement, which they say is also a 7 year (although the bottle is NAS), high-rye bourbon, but at 100 proof.","A warm and nicely layered aroma of rich caramel, vanilla, and oak. Despite leaning heavily on a traditional bourbon aroma, additional scents of orange chocolate, menthol, and lemon help bring dimension and a welcomed pop. Largely conventional on the surface, its underlying richness helps elevate it to satisfying levels.","A playful sweetness of caramel, vanilla, and oak form a quintessential bourbon palate. This backbone is offset by additional notes of mixed nuts, light cinnamon, and butterscotch. The palate isn’t immediately shocking in its flavors or construction, yet it all comes together nicely.","At medium length, the bourbon’s hot and dry finish doesn’t stick around long. That isn't necessarily a bad thing as it's unimpressive and far too familiar. Oak is the star, overpowering the bourbon’s caramel and vanilla theme. Its heat is amplified by a drop off in sweetness found in its palate as it becomes more spice focused. Passable overall and nothing to get too excited about either.","Old Ezra 101 Proof has been around for a long time yet never seemed to garner much attention. Over the years, Luxco tried different label designs, presumably to combat this, to little avail. Even as age statements dropped like flies, it wore its “Aged 7 Years” proudly, yet it seemed like bourbon drinkers didn’t care to notice.

It comes across as a sad tale of an unpopular kid trying whatever they can to get noticed. Some of this might be attributed to Luxco’s weak presence in the bourbon marketplace at the time. Before the company started to turn heads with Rebel Yell Single Barrel in 2016, and made a big splash with Old Ezra Barrel Strength in 2018, Old Ezra 101 Proof sat on the shelves hoping to get seen.

It’s not that Old Ezra 101 Proof tasted dramatically different from its competition, even with its 7 year age statement, but this is a curious case where an age statement didn’t draw very much attention to the bourbon. Be it marketing, brand awareness, or lack of passion for its parent company, Old Ezra 101 Proof couldn’t be saved. Now discontinued, but surprisingly still available if you search for it, it was replaced by a barrel strength version that was able to make an impact where the 101 Proof simply couldn’t. In my Old Ezra Barrel Strength review, I noted how the extra proof doesn’t suddenly transform this into a unique tasting product, but the extra proof takes the foundations of the bourbon and makes it into a richer, fuller-flavored, and all-around great tasting bourbon. And that’s the rub, outside of its age statement, Old Ezra 101 Proof isn’t all that special tasting, but instead doubles down on another important trait, offering decent quality at a great price.","Let’s get the obvious out of the way first: a 7 year old bourbon for around $25 is a great value. Age statements are starting to claw their way back onto bottles and can be found on many bottles under $50, (e.g. Old Ezra Barrel Strength $45, Knob Creek 9 Year $45, and 1792 12 Year $50). Even craft whiskeys as they come of age, are sporting more impressive age statements while slowly dropping in price. It has been said that Luxco sources their bourbon for Old Ezra from Heaven Hill, who just rebranded their Bottled in Bond bourbon from a 6 year release for $14, to a 7 year for $45. It's possible the economics aren’t there anymore for Luxco to continue this release, not when Old Ezra Barrel Strength has performed so well in the marketplace. Luxco’s David Nicholson Reserve Bourbon can be an adequate replacement, but at $35 and featuring a weaker finish, isn’t the one-to-one alternative fans of Old Ezra 101 Proof may love.",Old Ezra 101 Proof with its 7 year age statement is a holdover from the past: a no-frills bourbon that offers decent quality at a great price.,"We’re in the final moments of Old Ezra 101 before supply dries up and it’s gone from store shelves forever. It's tempting to go out and search for it now that it's discontinued and FOMO kicks in, however if you do, don’t have unrealistic expectations of it simply because it has an age statement. Its 7 years in the barrel helps give it a hearty caramel, vanilla, and oak backbone that often defines a quintessential bourbon profile, but it doesn’t offer much beyond that. Of course this is also true of the majority of bourbons in its price range.

With Old Ezra Barrel Strength born out of its ashes and improving on it in every way, that is the better buy. In a way it's sad that even after being discontinued a year and half ago it can still be found on store shelves. Perhaps after it's truly gone, opinions of it will change over time. I don’t think Luxco is ready to let Old Ezra 101 Proof fade into the sunset forever. They may let it rest peacefully for a few years before giving it another chance when their own distillate is ready for primetime.",Eric,3,3,2.5,3,3.5,3,https://www.breakingbourbon.com/review/old-ezra-7-year-101-proof
,Old Ezra 7 Year Barrel Strength,Classification: Straight Bourbon,Company: Luxco,Distillery: Undisclosed,Released: October 2018,Proof: 117,Age: 7 Years,"Mashbill: 78% Corn, 12% Malted Barley, 10% Rye",Color:  Copper,MSRP: $40 (2018),Official Website,"The Luxco bourbon portfolio consists of Rebel Yell, Ezra Brooks, Yellowstone, David Nicholson, and Blood Oath. The company is a non-distiller producer and has been said to have sourced their bourbon from Heaven Hill. In 2018, they completed construction of their own distillery in Bardstown, Kentucky on the Kentucky Bourbon Trail. According to the company, Lux Row Distillers features 18,000 square feet, six barrel warehouses at capacity and a 43-foot custom copper still capable of producing 3 million gallons of spirit per year. This distillery will produce the bourbon for the company's own brands and will replace sourced product when their bourbon comes of age.","A very traditional set of bourbon scents consisting of vanilla, caramel, brown sugar, and oak. Its mild for a high proof bourbon and its aromas are straightforward with no frills. Its basic and unexciting, yet solid nevertheless. It has a touch of cherry and spice near the end, but it’s fleeting and not at all impactful.","A surprisingly lively burst of flavor that ranges from sweet fruit, to rich caramel and spicy oak. Its heat can get in the way of the flavors at times, but doesn’t muddle or suppress them to a detrimental degree. This is a full-flavored affair, with adequate complexity and a very satisfying impact.","Oak, spice, and dark cherries ride the finish out to its natural conclusion. The heat is long lasting and doesn’t make it easy to forget. It’s a bit too dry and more thin than I would have liked, but thankfully there is a nice pop of vanilla and candied apple near the end that is short, but beneficial.","This release is much like what Luxco did two years ago when they breathed new life in the Rebel Yell brand - they released a new variant of a brand few ever took notice of, and it helped turn much needed attention towards it. Of course it also helped that Rebel Yell Single Barrel was quite good. The company is using that same strategy and hoping to create a similar success story for Ezra Brooks.

Ezra Brooks 7 Year 101 Proof is an often neglected and overlooked bourbon you may have seen on the shelf at one point or another, but probably rarely buy. The brand has been around for a long time and years ago when age statements were plentiful, it struggled for attention. Years later as the majority of mid-tier bourbon age statements disappeared, the bourbon is starting to get the attention it (rightfully?) deserves. Ezra Brooks 7 Year 101 Proof was never going to light the world on fire with its flavor profile, but still to this day, it offers what many other bourbons don’t: decent quality at a great price, and most notably, an age statement.

Luxco took what they did with Rebel Yell, what they were already doing well with Ezra Brooks 7 Year 101 Proof, upped the proof, and voila, they have a new product people can get behind. The flavor profile isn’t going to shock anyone with its uniqueness, but it is interesting how upping the proof changes this bourbon. It does what barrel proof bourbons are supposed to do but can sometimes struggle with. This isn’t just a hotter version of the standard offering, but a richer, fuller flavored, and all around great tasting bourbon.","Bourbon drinkers have become accustomed to barrel proof bourbons commanding a certain price. For years Booker’s maintained the industry line of $55, but like age statements, those days are long gone. 1792 has made a name for itself over the past four years releasing a number of new expressions well below market pricing, and that includes their Full Proof bourbon at $45. While some companies may try to hit this customer friendly pricing, few in reality actually do. That’s why it's even more surprising Old Ezra came in at $40 and maintained the brand’s mantra of quality bourbon at a great value. This release could have been marked up $10 higher and still would have easily been worth the price. Most importantly, this pricing keeps drinker expectations in check and in Old Ezra Barrel Strength’s case, perhaps it wasn’t even needed.","A high-proof, age-stated flavorful bourbon at an unbeatable price.","This release feels like a time capsule of what bourbon was like earlier this decade. Maybe its rose colored glasses, but this release brings me back to a time of quality bourbon, at a fair price, capped off with an age statement. There isn’t anything fancy here (besides its label). This is all around a great buy, that is bound to satisfy with its guilt-free expectations. This is the new everyday sipper/table bourbon for 2018.",Eric,2.5,3.5,3,3,4,3,https://www.breakingbourbon.com/review/old-ezra-7-year-barrel-strength
,Old Forester 1870 Original Batch Bourbon,Classification: Straight Bourbon,Company: Brown-Forman,Distillery: Brown-Forman Shively Distillery,Released: February 2015,Proof: 90,Age: NAS (4-4.5 years under heat cycle),"Mashbill: 72% Corn, 18% Rye, 10% Malted Barley",Color: Copper,MSRP: $45 (2015),Official Website,"Old Forester 1870’s name refers to the year that Brown-Forman founder George Garvin Brown began batching whiskey from three different distilleries (Atherton in Bardstown, Mattingly in Marion and Mellwood in Louisville) to ensure a consistent product. 1870 Original Batch is also blended by Marianne Barnes, the protégé of Brown-Forman’s master distiller, Chris Morris. It is said this would make 1870 the the first bourbon from a major producer blended by a woman in the modern era. The first batch of 1870 was 36 barrels. Brown-Forman intends for this to be a permanent brand.","Very bright and lively with its fruity and floral notes at the forefront. Underneath, vanilla and caramel provide the base and a delightful amount of oak is mixed in.",This a bourbon that actually tastes like it smells. It’s a delightful mingling of vibrant fruit flavors. The sweetness from the caramel and an agreeable amount of oak makes this an easy to enjoy bourbon.,"Despite a light body and thin mouthfeel, it has a really nice finish. As the sweetness trails off it finishes with cinnamon, nutmeg and a mix of other baking spices. A light amount of oak can also be tasted throughout the finish and helps provide a lasting aftertaste.","In the 1800’s bourbon was sold by the barrel which caused quality and taste to vary from release to release. Old Forester’s founder George Garvin Brown changed the industry by “batching” his bourbon. This meant that he took bourbons from three different distilleries and “batched” them together to create a consistent product. To commemorate this process and tradition, Brown-Forman is blending barrels from three different warehouses and three different days of production, each with varying entering proof to create 1870 Original Batch.

On paper, I’m not exactly sure why I should be excited about this release. Although Old Forester’s history makes a good story, this process nowadays is common practice. They state on their website that this “echoes” Brown’s original 1870 batching process, but I feel “echoes” might be too strong of a word in this case. There is no mention of mashbills and it’s unclear how this differs from their standard Old Forester brand. Blending from different warehouses at different proofs doesn’t scream unique. Does 1870 taste different than the standard Old Forester and Birthday Bourbon brands? While the brands share some basic flavor similarities, there are some major differences as well. If you blind taste tested them, I’m pretty confident most bourbon drinkers could accurately call them out. So the question is: Is 1870 worth the money?","Simply put, $45 for a batched bourbon seems on the high side. Old Forester released their limited edition Birthday Bourbon this year for $55 and I get the feeling that it’s a more carefully curated release than 1870 yet both are similar in price. Brown-Forman has given no indication that they’re picking honey barrels for this release, so I’m not entirely sure why this is priced at $45. Generally, higher priced bourbons (above $40) have a more informative story behind them that warrants the price. Most likely, Brown-Forman is simply filling a gap in their pricing structure with this new Whiskey Row brand. Ultimately, it always comes back to what’s in the bottle. This is easily an above average bourbon, so I’ll give it a pass on its slightly high asking price.",This is one easy drinker.,"After tasting 1870 Original Batch, I’m a lot more interested in Brown-Forman’s future plans for this series. The company plans to follow up this release with double barreled, 100 proof, and 125 proof variations on the same basic 1870 batch concept. As for this release, it will be remembered for its drinkability. It doesn’t try to challenge you like the limited edition Old Forester Birthday Bourbon does. It’s sweet and fruity and its tamed oak influence makes it go down easy. I didn’t know what to expect from this bourbon, but after having it I was surprised at the quality of the whole package. It’s priced a little on the high side, but you’re getting is a bourbon that anyone can enjoy.",Eric,3,3,3.5,3,2.5,3,https://www.breakingbourbon.com/review/old-forester-1870-original-batch-bourbon
,Old Forester 2009 Birthday Bourbon,Classification: Straight Bourbon,Company: Brown-Forman,Distillery: Brown-Forman Shively Distillery,Released: September 2009,Proof: 97,Age: 12 Years,"Mashbill: Undisclosed (Rumored to be 72% corn, 18% rye, and 10% malted barley)",Color:  Deep Copper,MSRP: $40 (2009),Official Website,"September 2nd marks the birthday of George Garvin Brown, one of the founders of Brown-Forman. To honor him, Brown-Forman released an Old Forester Birthday Bourbon. This bourbon is a special annual release that started in September 2002 and varies year to year based on age, warehouse location, number of barrels used, and so on. It comes in a special old fashioned glass bottle and the 2009 edition marks the 7th year that Brown-Forman has offered this bourbon.

According to the information on the bottle, the 2009 release is crafted from a 98 barrel batch of 97C19. These barrels were stored in the small warehouse B and larger warehouse J, on their 5th and 8th floors respectively. These upper floor locations exposed the barrels to a great degree of heat during the summer months.","This bourbon has a very refined smell to it. For a 97 proof bourbon, I was surprised at how upfront the alcohol was in the nose. Immediately past the alcohol smell is a delicious mixture of aged wood, caramel, raisins, and a hint of vanilla. The scent took me right to an aging warehouse in the KY countryside on a cool autumn day with all of the barrels aging. It could be the name influencing me here, but the combinations of smells gives off a sense of a delicious day old baked holiday cake. Really just a great nose on this bourbon.",You can tell that this bourbon has spent some time in the wood. The palate is best described as a slightly sweet earthy flavor. It starts with a mixture of light honey and leather and lingers on an oaky charred wood flavor. The combination plays nicely in your mouth together.,"The finish on this bourbon was very long, dry, and mild. Hints of butterscotch initially appeared up front, however, the finish was predominantly spicy, akin to a mild ground black pepper. While not bad, it didn’t blow me away like the nose did and was a distinct step down from the palate leading into it.","Don’t be fooled by thinking that this bourbon is just a marketing stunt due to the unique bottle shape chosen by Brown-Forman for this birthday series. Each yearly release of Old Forester Birthday Bourbon is completely unique when comparing it to the years before and after. Since the Birthday series usually uses the normal Old Forester Mashbill of 72% corn, 18% rye, and 10% malted, you get to see how aging has varied over time based on years spent in the barrel, location of the barrels, aging conditions, etc.

You also get to try Old Forester at a higher age and unique proof than what is normally offered. Higher in proof than Old Forester Classic (86 proof), slightly lower than Old Forester Signature (100 proof), and aged longer than both, it proves to be a nice variation for fans of Old Forester.  Less than 100 barrels are bottled on a yearly basis, which makes this one of the more consistent quality limited edition offerings on the market.","I’ve always found the Old Forester Birthday series to be a great value and the 2009 version was no exception to this. At $40, this was a great value back in ’09 when it was purchased. While it’s near impossible to find today and the price will be much higher on the secondary market, it’s being judged on the price that was paid at retail. Compared to say the yearly release of Four Roses Limited Edition Small Batch which usually retails for $100, this bourbon is a great deal at less than half the cost. You get a one-off unique bourbon that is full of flavor and can hold its own against newer releases on the market.",Who says you can’t have your cake and a bourbon to go with it too.,"I was really impressed with the 2009 version of the Old Forester Birthday Bourbon series. Brown Forman bottled a great above-average bourbon that nicely pays homage to George Gavin Brown. It’s a shame that the palate and finish can’t keep up with the really great nose. It really starts the bourbon off on such a high note.

My only real complaint comes to the bottle design. I realize that they’re trying to play up the fact that it's a celebration bottle and brought it to retail in an ""old fashioned"" style bottle. However, it takes up a lot of shelf space and is a pain to pour from, often spilling down the sides of the bottle. That being said, this bourbon is well above average and one that I would definitely recommend to anyone.",Jordan,4,3,2.5,3,4.5,3,https://www.breakingbourbon.com/review/old-forester-birthday-bourbon-2009
,Old Forester 2015 Birthday Bourbon,Classification: Straight Bourbon,Company: Brown-Forman,Distillery: Brown-Forman Shively Distillery,Released: September 2015,Proof: 100,Age: 12 Years,"Mashbill: Undisclosed (Rumored to be 72% corn, 18% rye, and 10% malted barley)",Color:  Copper,MSRP: $80 (2015),Official Website,"September 2nd marks the birthday of George Garvin Brown, one of the founders of Brown Forman. To honor him, Brown Forman released an Old Forester Birthday Bourbon. This bourbon is a special annual release that started in September 2002 and varies year to year based on age, warehouse location, number of barrels used, and so on. The bourbon comes in a special old fashioned glass bottle and is an anticipated release every year in the bourbon community. The 2014 bottling of Old Forester Birthday Bourbon marks the 14th year that Brown Forman has offered this bourbon. This is the first time Birthday Bourbon is being offered at 100 proof.

Master distiller Chris Morris has stated that “This particular lot of barrels is unusual because it matured in the same warehouse location instead of multiple sites. The lot aged near a window and close to a heat cycling duct, exposing all of the barrels to very high temperatures, resulting in the very robust, intense wood-derived characteristics...” Our Bourbon Barrel Aging infographic (see below)depicts this as spending more time in the “Extreme Aging Cycle.”","I’ve always found the Old Forester Birthday Bourbon series to have a great nose, and this year’s edition does not disappoint. “Rich” is the word that first comes to mind when I smell this bourbon. Dried tobacco leaves, mahogany, toasted oak, dried dark raisins and an underlying hint of chocolate are all noticeable. To me, this nose makes me think of fall. Rich in character and begging to be sipped outside on a deck while taking in the fall foliage.","What jumps out at me immediately with this year’s version is how much drier it is than in years past. While a very light honey sweetness is noticeable, predominate flavors are dried wood, mixed-nuts, and subtle hints of dried orange all swirl together. Compared to the 2014 edition, the extra 3 proof points doesn’t add any additional heat to the palate. While the palate is tasty and the notes of sweet honey were more noticeable the longer I let it open up, compared to the palate on recent past years versions, I feel this years palate doesn’t stand up to them as much.","Immediately noticeable is a peppery spice on the finish that seems to be isolated to my tongue only. This is followed by charred oak, leather, tobacco, and drier types of nuts such as a walnut for example. The nuttiness and heat linger and slowly dissipate over the next two minutes. It should be noted that the heat was isolated to my tongue only and never once moved down to my throat or stomach. This nutty finish is reminiscent of the 2009 edition with just a tad more spice upfront and a slightly fuller flavor profile.","The 2015 edition is an interesting bourbon to ponder. From a Birthday Bourbon series standpoint, it’s the highest proof release to date, along with the only edition where the barrels all come from a single warehouse. However, with the proof increase comes the fact that this year’s Birthday Bourbon is the same proof as Old Forester Signature. It needs to be noted though that the flavor profiles are totally different and the extra years in the barrel set this far apart from Old Forester Signature.

In terms of direct comparisons, this edition reminds me more of the 2009 edition more than any other recent past edition. Its woody, nutty flavor is a deviation of the sweetness usually found and the extra little spice on the finish was a nice addition. This series still tends to be the most consistently best tasting bourbon that Brown Forman produces each year in my book, and they should be given credit for this. It takes a lot to pull barrels from various warehouses (or a single warehouse in this year's case), with slightly different mashbills year after year and still release a really great product. Kudos to them on that point!","The past few years has seen the Birthday Bourbon series go up a few dollars every year, and the 2015 edition is no exception. It actually bests all previous increases by being priced about $20 higher than the $60 asking price of the 2014 edition. While in the past it was easy to justify the price due to the great nose the series has along with a flavor profile to back it up, but $80 is pushing the limit. At $80 Old Forester Birthday Bourbon is now priced the same or higher then a number of other limited released bourbons such as Michter’s Toasted Barrel Finish, Elijah Craig Barrel Proof, and the entire Buffalo Trace Antique Collection, not to mention everyday favorites such as Blanton’s Single Barrel and Four Roses Single Barrel.

Brown Forman realizes that there is a bourbon boom going on and that they can capitalize on it. And capitalize it they did. This year they specifically called out that there would only be 13,200 bottles for sale and even handed out t-shirts stating “I Went To Buy Old Forester Birthday Bourbon. And All I Got Was This Free T-Shirt” If that’s not feeding the whole bourbon hype, I don’t know what is.

Is this a good bourbon? Yes it is. In fact it’s the best thing that Brown Forman releases. That being said, when you ask if this is this a good bourbon for $80, the answer becomes more of a mixed bag. Sure you’re getting one of the more consistent limited edition releases for the money, however at the same time you're paying $80 for only a 12 year old 100 proof bourbon. When you get into this price range I expect more out of the bourbon itself... not just a good bourbon that is limited production.","Another solid Birthday Bourbon edition, although at a price point that is getting hard to justify for the series.","Every year I look forward to the Birthday Bourbon series, and this year was no exception. With that being said, I’m truly disheartened to see the price increase as much as it did this year. Hopefully it holds firm at $80, because any higher price point would almost be a direct insult to the consumers who look forward to it every year.

Additionally, when you get to the price point the Birthday Bourbon now plays in, consumers expect additional information on the bourbon they’re buying. It’s a shame that Brown Forman stopped providing specific mashbill and aging notes with their releases in 2013, as I’d love to see how closely this resembles the 2009 edition. Either way, it doesn’t seem like too much additional work to provide consumers with this information.

Also, I’ve said it before and I’ll say it again, but my biggest gripe for this series is the bottle design. I realize that Brown-Forman is trying to play up the fact that it's a celebration bottle and brought it to retail in an ""old fashioned"" style bottle. However, it takes up a lot of shelf space and is a pain to pour from, often spilling down the sides. I’m sure the design won’t change anytime soon and I’m sure I won’t stop complaining about the design on future editions.

All that being said, I still walked away from this year’s Birthday Bourbon with a smile on my face. The nose is once again fantastic and the other areas of the bourbon can back it up too. If you have the opportunity to buy a bottle, I highly recommend it. Even with the increased price, this bourbon is still worth exploring due to the solid flavor profile that it provides.

,Old Forester Signature 100 Proof Bourbon,Classification: Straight Bourbon,Company: Brown-Forman,Distillery: Old Forester Distilling Company,Release Date: Ongoing,Proof: 100,Age: NAS,"Mashbill: 72% Corn, 18% Rye, 10% Malted Barley",Color: Deep Copper,MSRP: $30 (2019),Official Website,"Old Forester Signature 100 Proof doesn’t actually say “Signature” anywhere on its bottle. It gets its name in honors the legacy of founder George Garvin Brown, which features his signature on every bottle. Old Forester is the longest running bourbon brand on the market and was the first bourbon sold exclusively in sealed bottles. The brand is also noted as one of the few whiskeys that was allowed to be sold during Prohibition for medicinal purposes (it's even featured on the bottle’s label). There is also an 86 proof Old Forester bourbon that is called “Classic.”","Sweet caramel and a cherry brightness spring from the glass, followed by ample amount of oak. This aroma is nicely balanced and inviting. It may not be overly complex, but its pleasantness makes up for it.","Bold oak, punchy pecans, and caramelized maple syrup drive home the richness of this sip. The mouthfeel however, is thinner than expected, based on the heft of the flavors. Thankfully this doesn’t deter from the overall palate since the proof also does a lot to make up for it.","Pepper, clove, and seasoned oak get the spotlight during the finish. They fit well with the palate’s flavor profile and bring a bit more complexity to the finish. It unfortunately follows its non-Old Forester Whiskey Row bourbons and features an aftertaste thats mildly danky and overly oaked, resulting in a bitter taste. It tastes toned down from years past where it was overpowering. It doesn’t derail the entire finish, but puts a blemish on an otherwise solid pour.","For the longest time the Old Forester brand suffered from brand identity. They have been one of the big boys on the shelf, but there just wasn’t any excitement surrounding the brand. They offer Birthday Bourbon special release once a year, that until about five years ago, no one cared about. It wasn’t much longer after that something began to change. They started showcasing Marianne Barnes as master distiller Chris Morris’ protégée and let her loose on the first release in a new whiskey brand for the company, Whiskey Row. Fast forward a few years, Marianne Barnes is well know within the bourbon community and has since left to head up Castle & Key, and after four acclaimed Whiskey Row releases, the Old Forester brand finds themselves reinvigorated in their products, their snazzy downtown Louisville distillery, and overall brand perception.

With a new brand-wide bottle label refresh in tow, Old Forester has changed and that is most apparent with Old Forester Signature 100 Proof. Still sporting the brand’s typical flavor profile, the bourbon overall tastes much more rich and full-flavored. Its 100 proof is spot-on providing warmth and intensity of flavors while still keeping it a gentle sipper. It might not be overly unique, but it is a much improved and higher quality pour than it’s been in a long time. It more closely resembles its more expensive and well-received Whiskey Row bourbons at a more introductory and everyday price. And most importantly of all, it's in a position to make a name for itself, by providing its competition with quality counterpoint.","Not exactly a budget bourbon anymore as it creeps into the $30 range, Old Forester Signature will be an introductory bourbon to a lot of people, or an everyday bourbon to more seasoned drinkers. This price range comes with certain expectations though, like a more memorable flavor profile, that while not overly complex, still provides some flavor depth and sophistication. Evan Williams Single Barrel, Four Roses Small Batch, and Eagle Rare all accomplish this within this price range. Old Forester 86 and 100 proof bourbons have struggled with this for many years. They were far from bad bourbons, they just weren’t all that memorable. Unfortunately what was most memorable about them was their dreadful finish. With this nearly fixed, and a rich palate and respectable depth, Old Forester Signature now provides a solid pour at a great price point.  ","As a much improved product, Old Forester Signature 100 Proof goes a long way correcting its past wrongs, and can finally stand toe-to-toe with its competition.","Since the release of the Whiskey Row series, I always wondered why there was such a divide in quality from those releases to the more budget friendly 86 and 100 proof Old Forester releases. Brown-Forman must have also been aware of this, as the current release of Old Forester Signature 100 Proof goes a long way bridging the quality gap between the brands. In fact, tasting this side by side with Old Forester 1897 Bottled in Bond, the Signature’s finish is the only thing holding this bourbon back from being on almost equal footing. This is quite an accomplishment for a bourbon $20 cheaper.

Old Forester’s portfolio is more unified in its branding and flavor profile than it's ever been, and provides a more sequential path for drinkers to take as they go up in price. Its main flaw is that it still suffers from a below average finish despite being much improved over years past. It’s not enough to make a good bourbon bad, but it might be keeping a good bourbon from being great. After years of struggling in the $20-$30 price range, Old Forester finally has a much-improved bourbon that can proudly stand up to its competition.",Eric,3,3,2,2.5,3,3,https://www.breakingbourbon.com/review/old-forester-signature-100-proof-bourbon

As bourye blends become ever more popular, this comes off as a more serious entry. It takes its namesake seriously by tasting like a stiff drink your grandfather would have sipped on.

,Old Grand-Dad Bonded Bourbon,Classification: Straight Bourbon,Company: Beam Suntory,Distillery: Jim Beam,Release Date: Ongoing,Proof: 100,Age: 4 Years,"Mashbill: 63% Corn, 27% Rye, 10% Malted Barley",Color: Dark Honey,Price: $25 (2020),Official Website,"The Old Grand-Dad brand was created by Raymond B. Hayden and named after his grandfather Meredith Basil Hayden, Sr. The bourbon has been in production since the 1800’s, including during Prohibition when it was produced by American Medicinal Spirits Co., a pharmaceutical company. The brand has changed ownership numerous times since it was originally created and is now owned by Beam Suntory and marketed as part of their “The Olds” Collection which also includes Old Overholt. Old Grand-Dad is currently released in three different bottling proofs: 80 (changed from 86 in 2013), 100, and 114.

The bottle in review is the 100 proof variant, and is labelled “Bonded” which is short for Bottled in Bond. To be labelled Bottled in Bond, the whiskey must be the product of one distillation season and one distiller at a single distillery, aged in a federally bonded warehouse under U.S. government supervision for at least four years, and it must be bottled at exactly 100 proof. Additionally, the Bottled in Bond label must clearly identify the distillery where it was distilled and where it was bottled, if different.","A wave of cinnamon leads the charge, followed by sweet caramel, vanilla, and a hint of burnt oak. Cinnamon dominates overall, but the balance of sweeter scents along with the oak keeps it manageable. While it comes across as somewhat one-dimensional, it's still inviting.","Big cinnamon spice pops upfront with a flash of Fireball candy potency. Dark fruit and baking spices follow, along with a touch of rye spice. It has a nice intensity, and like the nose, the cinnamon dominates and is also quite pleasant. It's medium-bodied with a nice mouthfeel.","Sweet flavors of caramel candy and raw sugar develop first, followed by baking spices and a very light display of seasoned oak. The finish is medium-length and has just the right amount of intensity. Enjoyable overall and leaves a good impression.","Old-Grand Dad is one of the oldest and most storied brands on store shelves, but despite this, the brand seems to receive little fanfare among bourbon enthusiasts and very little marketing effort from current owner Beam Suntory. The higher 114 proof version was even rumored to be discontinued in 2017, though it still exists today and pops up in discussions from time to time.

Old Grand-Dad bourbons are made from a high rye mashbill containing 27% rye, which is likely the source of its heavy cinnamon spice flavor found throughout the 100 proof Bonded variant. It also falls in between the lower 80 proof and higher 114 proof versions, and to that end, balances flavor and drinkability the best of the three.

Jim Beam also produces another brand that honors Old Grand-Dad, which is aptly named Basil Hayden’s after the man himself. Made from the same high rye mashbill, the standard Basil Hayden’s Bourbon is released at 80 proof and marketed as a premium bourbon in ultra-premium packaging. I find it’s often one new bourbon drinkers refer to as a favorite, but more seasoned bourbon drinkers complain about its price, low proof, and the fact that its best quality is the effective marketing strategy behind it. By comparison, Old Grand-Dad Bonded packs a lot more punch at 100 proof, giving it a leg up on its premium lackluster counterpart, and also helping it more successfully stand apart from the crowd.

I tasted this recent batch in review against an older open bottle of Old Grand-Dad Bonded I had purchased in 2013 or so. While I never disliked the particular bottle, I often relegated it to mixing or just an occasional pour simply because it had ""been a while."" By comparison, the newer batch is quite a bit more enjoyable, albeit cinnamon-heavy against its more ethanol-heavy and less balanced 2013 counterpart. In fact, I found the two to not even taste like the same brand when sipped side by side.","Like a rising tide, we’ve watched bourbon’s prices climb with many new releases, but less so with existing brands. This is true of Old Grand-Dad, which has maintained low prices across the brand.

While Old Grand-Dad Bonded is readily available and sees widespread distribution, it’s not a bourbon that’s on every liquor store shelf, and often when it is there is only a small supply of it. The brand’s storied history and familiarity seems to resonate with long-time fans, yet I doubt many new bourbon drinkers reach for a bottle of Old Grand-Dad on liquor store shelves, instead reaching for Basil Hayden's, Old Grand-Dad's pricier (and fancier) counterpart...or just simply any other brand with a snazzier bottle. I remembered an article from years ago where theoretical packaging designs were created for the brand as part of a design project, and at the time I remembered thinking how much better they were than the bourbon’s current packaging design, which has changed quite a bit over the years.

Getting past packaging design reveals a pretty tasty bourbon that’s readily available for a good price, sometimes even under $20 if you look in the right place. Based on the batch in review, what’s being bottled today is quite a bit better than what was being bottled just six years ago. So while Old Grand-Dad Bonded might not engage us with effective packaging design, it holds its own against others in the price range including its higher proof and somewhat unbalanced brother, Old Grand-Dad 114.","Old Grand-Dad Bonded might not have the snazziest packaging design, but at $25, this quality, storied bourbon should have a place on every bourbon drinker's shelf.","Old Grand-Dad seems like a brand that everyone respects, but rarely talks about. Maybe it’s the name, the packaging design, or the fact that its low price and general availability make it somehow seem less exciting. Given the quality of this recent batch of Old Grand-Dad Bonded, I’m going to make it a point to reach for the bottle more often. And at only $25 or so for a bottle, it’s worth visiting, or revisiting, if you don’t already have it in your regular rotation.",Nick,2.5,3,3,3,3.5,3,https://www.breakingbourbon.com/review/old-grand-dad-bonded-bourbon

They produce Wathen's, Old Medley and Medley Brothers Kentucky bourbons, which are bottled by Frank-Lin. Old Medley is the same recipe as Wathen’s, but aged 12 years. Only 2,500 cases are being distributed for this one time release.","A sweet aroma hits you first, followed by a good amount of oak.  A surprise amount of alcohol hits you for a 86 proofer. A longer whiff conjures up grain, leather and rye notes.","It has quite the flavor blast of aged vanilla, caramel and a dash of Mr. Goodbar. The bourbon is on the sweet side before the spice from the rye mingles in. The palate has a decent amount of depth to it and is definitely the highlight of this bourbon.","The alcohol taste immediately hits the roof of your mouth and lingers. Despite it being a full-bodied bourbon, the flavor drops off immediately with little trace that it was even there. Dry finish.",There’s nothing immediately flashy with this bourbon. The nose is surprising sweet with layered aromas despite the oak and alcohol being very present. The palate comes off at first as any run-of-the-mill bourbon. It’s not until you have a few sips and let the bourbon sit on your tongue that you realize the finer points the bourbon has. The sweet/spicy palate can be interesting if you pay enough attention to it.,"At $50 a bottle it’s overpriced, plain and simple. It's no doubt a quality bourbon, but it isn’t unique enough to warrant being priced on the high side of bourbon’s pricing curve. There are far too many quality bourbons priced in the $30 and low $40 range that are just better than this. That being said, there are some stores selling this below MSRP, which muddles the discussion. $40 for this bourbon is an average value. At the MSRP of $50, it’s overpriced.","A straight forward and quality bourbon, but largely forgettable.","In music you often hear the term ""deep cut"" or ""deep track"" to describe a lesser known song from an artist.  Old Medley kind of feels like a deep cut. It's not a bombastic bourbon but it has some finer points that make it worth visiting or revisiting. If you’re looking to branch out beyond the usual suspects you find everyday at the liquor store, Old Medley can play that role well. There are plenty of decent aspects to this bourbon that will keep anyone happy, there just aren’t any that will excite you.",Eric,3,3,2,3,2,3,https://www.breakingbourbon.com/review/old-medley-12-year-bourbon
,Peerless Small Batch Barrel Proof Bourbon,Classification: Straight Bourbon,Company: Kentucky Peerless Distilling Company,Distillery: Kentucky Peerless Distilling Company,Release Date: Ongoing,Proof: 109.5,Age: NAS,"Mashbill: Undisclosed (Corn [estimated 65-81%], Rye [estimated 10-20%], Malted Barley [estimated 9-15%])",Color: Medium Copper,MSRP: $70 (2020),Official Website,"Peerless is a storied brand that dates back to the 1880’s when it was first barreled and sold by E.W. Worsham & Co. Operations based in Henderson, Kentucky. Like so many other distilleries during the time, the distillery and the Peerless brand became a victim of Prohibition. In 2014, the Peerless brand was reborn as Corky and Carson Taylor refurbished a building in downtown Louisville and obtained the original Kentucky Distilled Spirits Plant Number (DSP-KY-50) from the original Peerless Distillery in the 1800’s. In March of 2015 they barreled their first rye.

Kentucky Peerless Small Batch Barrel Proof Bourbon was first released to market in June, 2019, marking 102 years since bourbon had been sold by the company. Peerless Bourbon is made using a sweet mash process, meaning no backset is used in the fermentation process. This is a less popular method in the industry than the sour mash process, and arguably more difficult to control. The distillate that will eventually become Peerless Bourbon enters the barrel at 107 proof, which is much less than the legal maximum of 125 proof. Once aged at least four years, it is blended in small batches, non-chill filtered, and bottled at barrel proof.

The bottle in review is identified with a serial number of 150617107. While Peerless maintains a database of serial numbers in order to provide additional information on their website, it does not appear to be up-to-date.","Pipe tobacco marries ripe summer fruit and seasoned oak. Aromas of sweet caramel and butterscotch mingle in. A healthy dose of heat is also present, but merely to the extent that it reminds you of the bourbon’s proof. Good overall, but not memorable.","A heavy dose of caramel intermingles with a punch of savory tobacco. Toasted marshmallows, barrel char, and light butterscotch echo in the background. Light rye spice weaves in towards the end. It’s surprisingly modest considering the proof, and has a great mouthfeel resulting in an impressive sip overall.","Rye spice from the palate intensifies, with a nice balance of sweet caramel alongside it. Ripe fruit emerges, and to a small degree, tobacco and butterscotch reappear. Despite the emergence of additional flavors, spice remains the highlight in this satisfying, medium-length finish.","Kentucky Peerless’ storied history and generally enthusiastic fanbase has served the company well since it’s revitalization in 2014. Sweet mash, 107 barrel entry proof, true small batches, non-chill filtration, and barrel proof are all elements that fall on the less popular side of bourbons you’ll typically see on a liquor store shelf. These aspects of this bourbon’s creation are not exceptionally rare, but do help elevate it from the masses. And while the resulting flavor profile is not exceptionally unique, it does deliver a combination of flavors and robust mouthfeel that certainly isn’t “common” either.","While their 2 year rye and 3 year rye were impressive for such a young age, their high price tag was an obvious deterrent for many ($125 for the 2 year rye when we reviewed it). Peerless Bourbon still maintains a premium price tag, but it's at least double the age and at $70 almost half of the 2 year rye’s price and as a result the price is much more palatable. It’s still quite a premium for what’s inside the bottle, but given Peerless’ enthusiastic following, relatively small release numbers, and inferred desire to establish a premium brand, the price is not surprising. The product is entirely their own creation, and it is safe to say few will be disappointed so long as they understand there is a built-in premium here.","Peerless Bourbon shows off the distillery’s prowess with a seriously legit, high-quality bourbon - but leaves room to grow into its premium $70 price tag.","With any bourbon, expectations must be kept in check. With many young distilleries, I don’t expect much from their initial round of bourbon releases. Kentucky Peerless is one of the exceptions, breaking free of the stigma many craft distilleries work so desperately to overcome. It's a relatively young small batch bourbon that can literally go toe to toe with products double its age or created by much more tenured legacy distilleries. But again expectations must be kept in check, as $70 is a premium price for bourbon. There are definitely better products in that price range - older, higher proof, and exceptionally crafted in many cases. Peerless Bourbon will undoubtedly grow into that price and then some, but in the meantime it’s a satisfying bourbon representing a company with a bright future.",Nick,2.5,3.5,3,3,2,3,https://www.breakingbourbon.com/review/peerless-small-batch-barrel-proof-bourbon
,Pinhook Bourbon Country Cask Strength,Classification: Straight Bourbon,Company: CJS Beverage Corp.,Distillery: MGP,Release Date: March 2018,Proof: 115.3,Age: 3 years,"Mashbill: 70% Corn, 20.5% Rye, 4.5% Malted Barley",Color: Yellow Gold,MSRP: $50 (2019),Official Website,"The Crop 18 Grouping by Pinhook is comprised of a rye whiskey named Rye Humor and Bourbon Country Bourbon. Bourbon Country comes in three variations including a standard Straight Bourbon, Single Barrel, and Cask Strength. Bourbon Country Cask Strength is the first cask strength bourbon bottled under the Pinhook name. The bourbon itself was distilled at MGP in Indiana. Pinhook states that the bourbon has an average age of three years and eight months and was aged, blended, and proofed by Sean Josephs at Castle & Key Distillery in Frankfort, KY.  

Through a partnership with Bourbon Lane Stable LLC, each lot of Pinhook whiskey showcases an individual thoroughbred. For the first cask strength release, Bourbon Country was chosen. Foaled April 17, 2014, Bourbon Country was bred at Alamar Farm, LLC and is the son of Harlan's Holiday and Uninhibited Song. In addition to the horse, each release of Pinhook is distinguished by a different color wax, with Bourbon Country Cask Strength sporting purple wax for the first time in the brand’s history.","Light but lively, candied orange and white cake nicely blend together. They’re joined by a touch of vanilla, light oak, and pepper. A light layer of ethanol lies in wait, and appears with a heavy sniff. A nice way to start off the sip.","The palate is slightly youthful and a stark contrast from the nose. Where the nose is mostly sweet, the palate is a bold spicy burst of rye that really shines through. It combines with a mixture of nuts, oak, black pepper, and a touch of sweet vanilla. It’s surprising how much the rye shines through for the percentage in the mix, but the end result is a bold palate that surprises with each sip.","The finish starts with a touch of warming heat as the rye spice carries through. Additionally, there is a brief hint of vanilla and peaches to start the finish. These fade leaving straw, oak, and leather on the backend. The finish ends on a lingering spicy rye and dry leather note. While it’s a perfectly nice way to end, it's also the weakest part of the sip by comparison.","A cask strength bourbon in and of itself isn’t anything overly unique. Sure a nod should be given to Pinhook for offering Bourbon Country in standard, single barrel and cask strength versions, however this wouldn’t be the first time this was done. Makers allows this on a larger scale with their Maker’s & Maker's 46 lines, which come in standard, cask strength, and single barrel versions through single barrel selections that stores/groups do.

What makes Pinhook Bourbon Country Cask Strength really unique in my book is the interplay between the bright fresh sweet nose and the bold spicy palate. They’re so contrasting from each other and unexpected that it brings forth an experience so rarely seen in a cask strength bourbon. This contrast also plays well for the youth of this bourbon, as it  masks the young age more than you would normally find for a bourbon this age. No matter how many times I sipped this, I was still surprised each time the transition happened. In a sea full of commonplace cask strength bourbons, it’s a nice change to experience.","Bourbon Country Cask Strength may seem expensive for a bourbon aged three years, in reality, it’s priced accordingly in today’s marketplace. It competes in the same price range that you’ll find bourbons such as Bulleit Barrel Strength, and for a few dollars less than what a bottle of Elijah Craig Barrel Proof generally sells for. While it depends on the batch of Elijah Craig Barrel Proof, generally speaking Bourbon Country falls neatly in between these two lines sipwise and is priced accordingly. The fair price lends to the fact that you can pair this with either a single barrel version of Bourbon Country or the standard version for $100 or less, for a fun and reasonably priced face off.",Pinhook’s first foray into cask strength bourbon delivers a solid start thanks to a surprising transition of flavors between the nose and palate.,"Bourbon Country Cask Strength came as a surprise to me. While I’ve enjoyed their rye in the past, and knew they blend to mask the age well, I didn’t have high hopes for a 3 year old bourbon. However, after sitting with this bourbon on multiple occasions now, I walk away pleasantly surprised.

The youth of this bourbon plays a very little role in the overall sip. Despite its age briefly shining through in its palate, overall this bourbon punches above its weight, thanks in large part to its palate. Rich in bold spicy flavor, the palate delivers a delightful contrast to the lively nose, and I found myself going back often to experience this transition. There are better, more nuanced cask strength bourbons available on the market, but when factoring in the price and the flavors of the sip, Pinhook Bourbon Country Cask Strength delivers a solid first entrance into the brand’s cask strength line.",Jordan,3,3.5,2.5,3.5,2.5,3,https://www.breakingbourbon.com/review/pinhook-bourbon-country-cask-strength
,Pinhook Bourbon War Vertical Series - 4 Year,Classification: Straight Bourbon,Company: CJS Beverage Corp.,Distillery: MGP,Release Date: August 2019,Proof: 98,Age: 4 Years,"Mashbill: 75% Corn, 20.5% Rye, and 4.5% Malted Barley",Color: Gold,MSRP: $45,Website,"Bourbon War 4 Year represents the first release in a 9 year vertical series. Every year Pinhook will create a small batch from a set of barrels that was distilled in Lawrenceburg, Indiana. This will allow consumers to experience the slight nuances of how bourbon changes as it gains an extra year in the barrel. The series will eventually conclude with a 12 year old bourbon released in 2027.

For the inaugural year, 150 barrels were selected and were proofed to 98 proof, however the proof may vary year to year as the series progresses. Additionally, the price won’t stay consistent either. Each annual release will increase an estimated $5-10, taking into account the cost of storing the barrels as they continue to age.

Through a partnership with Bourbon Lane Stable LLC, each lot of Pinhook whiskey showcases an individual thoroughbred. According to Pinhook, Bourbon War was foaled on February 23, 2016. Bourbon War after narrowly missing the 2019 Kentucky Derby, was able to run in the Preakness as well as The Belmont.","The nose opens with a theme of smoke. Toasted marshmallows, barrel char, and toasted grain pop up front. Lingering beneath are hints of baked bananas, green peppers, and corn. While the scents don’t hit hard, it’s a surprisingly complex nose for a four year old bourbon. The smoke theme plays well and continues to draw you back in for more.","Cereal grain, vanilla, and light bananas start off the sip. Searching deeper pulls out sweeter hints of summer fruits and bubble gum, along with an underlying line of oak. Overall while the palate is on the thinner side, it still delivers a pleasing set of flavors that make for a very easy sip.","The sip ends on notes of light sweet vanilla, oak, and sweet fruits. These flavors transition to white peppercorns and sweet fruits, eventually ending on a note of a tempered oak. After a stronger start in the nose and palate, the finish is the weakest part of the overall sip, as it just delivers a ho-hum ending to what otherwise is a well-rounded bourbon.","Vertical series isn’t a new concept. Orphan Barrel’s Rhetoric line is the most notable that comes to mind, and ran for a total of 6 releases. In fact, even Pinhook itself has done vertical series in shorter, 6 month increments in the past with their Bourbon Courage line that ran over a period of 3 years.

What makes Bourbon War unique is the length in which it will be run along with the age range it will cover. Bourbon drinkers will get the chance to try a series of bourbons as the barrels age from 4 years to 12 years, over a 9 year span. This will allow consumers to see the progression over time, and more importantly, hone in on what age is preferred by their own palate. With the 4 year bourbon setting a solid foundation, it will be really interesting to see how aging in oak longer helps progress these blends over time.","Coming in at $45, Bourbon War 4 Year will be the lowest cost of the entire vertical series, with the 12 year potentially showcasing a price of up to $135 or more. The sip highlighted in the initial release is good, forgoing many of the youthful traits you’d expect for a young bourbon. That said, it’s clear you're paying to buy into this experience, as $45 will still get you many great easy to find bottles, even in today’s marketplace.

In the end, the sip delivered, combined with the fact that this is part of a bigger broader experiment, helps justify its price for this edition. Now it has yet to be seen if this same logic will hold true for future releases, especially with their increasing price tag. My prediction is that some justify the price, while others may miss the mark, especially as they start to creep up to a triple digit price tag. In the meantime, the 4 year edition comes in at a fair starting point.",Bourbon War 4 Year kicks off a multi-year journey for bourbon drinkers with a decent sip that has potential to shine even more as time goes on.,"I’m always excited when whiskey companies take a chance on something new. Whether it’s a unique barrel finish, differentiating grain, or in this case, an aging experiment, I always like when individuals help progress bourbon drinkers in their journey. In the case of Bourbon War Vertical Series, Pinhook is giving consumers the opportunity to hone in on their ideal age range, which might surprise some with what they walk away preferring.

From an actual sip perspective, Bourbon War 4 Year lays a good foundation. It starts strong in the nose and ends weaker in the finish, it provides unique yet balanced flavors that will be interesting to see how age progresses them. I would be remiss not to note that since these are blends, each year could present a totally different flavor profile, however that will be part of the fun of exploring this series over the coming years. If you do decide to go on this vertical journey, make sure you set a little aside from each year to compare. After all, 9 years is a long time away when it comes to the world of bourbon.

Editor’s Note: When this review was originally published, the MSRP was stated at $50 per the company's press release.

Bourbon Lane states that they are hopeful that he will resume training in the coming months and reach his potential late in 2020 and 2021.","You’re immediately greeted with a scent that’s undeniably MGP rye.This isn’t necessarily a bad thing as I find MGP ryes, especially at a younger age, to be approachable with a flavor profile that most can appreciate. Ripe summer fruits waft up and mix with rye spice and light oak. The nose isn't particularly complex, but it’s certainly a very inviting one to open up the sip with.","Brown sugar, cinnamon spiced apple pie, and a return of ripe summer fruits appear up front. Lingering behind is a vanilla oak swirl that pulls everything together nicely. It’s a lovely combination that’s sweet with just the right amount of oak to balance things out. While it certainly won’t scratch the itch of spicy rye lovers, it delivers a sip that is really hard to dislike.","The finish is missing the sweeter notes found in the nose and palate. Instead, it starts with oak, which is joined by vanilla, white peppercorn, and a dab of rye spice and leather. These flavors fade and you’re left with a lingering dry oak on the backend.","Pinhook is no stranger to vertical series, having done a shorter 6 month increment one in the past with their Bourbon Courage line, which ran over a period of 3 years. Pinhook more recently launched the Bourbon War vertical series in 2019. Much like its bourbon brother, Bourbon War, Pinhook’s Tiz Rye Time pushes the boundaries of what has been done in a vertical series.

Over 9 years, consumers will get a chance to follow these MGP barrels as they age from 4 to 12 years old, culminating with the final release taking place in 2028. This affords consumers the hands-on opportunity to taste how whiskey changes as it ages. More importantly, it’s a fun experiment that allows whiskey drinkers to hone in on what age is preferred by their own palate.","Just like Bourbon War 4 Year, Tiz Rye Time 4 Year will be the lowest cost of the entire vertical series at $45. This is necessary as the final release aged 12 years will potentially showcase a price of up to $135 or more. But know what you’re receiving with the 4 Year edition is a classic younger-tasting MGP rye.

While many distilleries are playing with barrel finishes, grain types, and mashbill variations, no one is attempting to tackle what Pinhook is currently doing with their vertical bourbon and rye series.

Tiz Rye Time 4 Year delivers a well-rounded sip and sets a solid foundation for this vertical series. It will be interesting to see how its flavor profile changes over the years. Will its fruitiness remain as a highlight, or will the oak pull forward more spice along the way? More fascinating is the journey this vertical series will take drinkers and what conclusions they will discover along the way.

,Rittenhouse Rye Bottled in Bond,Classification: Straight Rye,Company: Heaven Hill,Distillery: Heaven Hill,Released: Ongoing,Proof: 100,Age: NAS,"Mashbill: 51% Rye, 37% Corn, 12% Malted Barley",Color: Copper,MSRP: $25 (2017),Official Website,"Rittenhouse Rye is produced in the tradition of the classic Pennsylvania or ""Monongahela"" rye whiskeys, which are believed to have had a spicier and fruitier flavor profile. This style is said to be a high rye mashbill consisting of 80-100% rye grain. Ironically Rittenhouse is a low rye (51%) which is typical of the modern Kentucky rye mashbill.

This is a Bottled in Bond (BiB) rye. To be labelled BiB, the whiskey must be the product of one distillation season and one distiller at a single distillery, aged in a federally bonded warehouse under U.S. government supervision for at least four years, and it must be bottled at exactly 100 proof. Additionally, the BiB label must clearly identify the distillery where it was distilled and where it was bottled, if different.","A nice mixture of fruit and grain are immediately noticeable. Dried bananas and light peaches are mixed with hints of malty grains. It reminds me of a bowl of breakfast oatmeal in the sense that it’s a pleasing scent but one that’s very mellow and light. Surprisingly, it’s not very spicy at all.","The peaches and dried bananas from the nose carry over, and now they’re nicely mixed with white pepper with a dash of spice. While the pepper and spice mixture is nice, it’s far from being your typical bold spicy rye flavor profile which you see with a lot of modern day ryes. Instead it’s more on the mellow fruity end. Additionally, Rittenhouse Rye doesn’t have a heavy mouthfeel however it’s also not light by any means. It’s really nicely balanced overall.","Leather, lightly charred oak, and light peach along with pepper and a dash of classic rye spice are all noticeable. While there’s a pleasant dash of heat up front, it’s not overly hot, and not overly spicy. Dried fruit and white pepper linger for a while on the back end of the finish.  While the finish is definitely on the shorter side and I wish it lasted longer, it’s still very enjoyable.","By virtue of there only being two mainstream BiB ryes in the market (the other being E.H. Taylor Straight Rye), Rittenhouse automatically becomes slightly unique. However, where it distinguishes itself is in the fact that this is one of the fruitier mainstream ryes on the market. While hints of rye spice try to surface in the palate and the finish, I can’t think of any other nationally distributed rye that packs this much fruit in the overall flavor profile.

Similar to Woodford Reserve Rye, which is another rye that has an non typical flavor profile and low rye in the mashbill, some might be surprised by what they find during their first sip. This is especially true if one bought this rye expecting to find a more typical spicier and hotter rye flavor profile found in many modern day ryes. That being said while Woodford Reserve Rye leans more towards a typical bourbon flavor profile, Rittenhouse Rye still grounds itself as a rye, just one that’s very fruit-forward. As a result, this might be appealing to bourbon drinkers looking to begin an exploration into ryes, as it does not have the intense spice many other modern day ryes offer.","While the number of ryes in the marketplace is much smaller than the number of bourbons, the price range is similar. Coming in at $25, Rittenhouse Rye is one of the more budget-friendly ryes in the marketplace with others like Jim Beam Rye, Wild Turkey Rye, and Old Overholt coming in a few dollars cheaper. This is priced right to be either a sipper or as a great fruit-forward cocktail base. Because of this, Rittenhouse is priced perfectly for what it is. You won’t feel like you overpaid for it, even with a flavor profile leaning heavily away from your typical bold spicy rye.","Don’t let its fruit forward flavor profile fool you, this is definitely a pleasant rye that’s worth a try.","If you’re searching for a bold spicy rye, you won’t find it here. However, if you have an open mind to a more mellow fruitier rye, you’ve come to the right place. Additionally for individuals who usually drink bourbon but are just exploring ryes, this is a nice “bridging” rye that helps you start to explore the world of ryes without jumping straight into the bolder spicier ones.

Rittenhouse Rye may start with a weaker nose, but it pulls through and redeems itself with a slightly more pleasant palate and finish. The fruit mixes nicely with the light pepper and heat and provides a really easy to drink rye. Combined with the fact that this drinks lower than its 100 proof leads you to believe, I found myself drinking through this quicker than I thought I would. Sure it’s not mindblowing, but because it can easily be found on most shelves for $25 and it can be enjoyed either neat, straight-up, or in a cocktail, it makes for a really great versatile rye worth trying.",Jordan,2.5,3,3,2.5,3,3,https://www.breakingbourbon.com/review/rittenhouse-rye-bottled-in-bond
,Russell’s Reserve 10 Year Bourbon,Classification: Straight Bourbon,Company: Campari Group,Distillery: Wild Turkey,Release Date: Ongoing,Proof: 90,Age: 10 Years,"Mashbill: 75% Corn, 13% Rye, 12% Malted Barley",Color: Light Amber,Price: $38 (2020),Official Website,"Russell’s Reserve 10 Year is part of Wild Turkey’s Russell’s Reserve line named in honor of Jimmy and Eddie Russell, the father-son master distiller team that have a combined tenure at Wild Turkey in excess of 100 years. Russell’s Reserve 10 Year is a small batch bourbon that’s comprised of hand-selected barrels that have been aged for at least 10 years, but possibly more. Like all of Wild Turkey’s bourbons, it’s made from their single bourbon mashbill.","Strong aromas of vanilla and caramel come forward, with whiffs of aged oak, graham cracker, and leather following. It’s a strikingly quintessential bourbon aroma, and given its lower 90 proofpoint, surprisingly robust. Very pleasant overall offering little to take issue with.","Again quintessential bourbon flavors take the lead, with caramel and vanilla notes resting against tobacco and seasoned oak. A slight rye spice also weaves in, but allows the other flavors to show more prominently. The bourbon has a nice mouthfeel, albeit slightly thin. No different than the nose, there is nothing at all off-putting, and the flavors present themselves in a very straightforward and matter-of-fact way.","Rye spice reaches its crescendo in the finish, leading the charge as the flavors climax in full force. The spice quickly fades, revealing vestiges of toasted marshmallows, leather, tobacco, and again, fairly prominent caramel and vanilla notes. It turns slightly dry as it fades away, but leaves a warming feeling in your chest.","As double-digit age statements on everyday-available brands seemed to fade away in recent years, Russell’s Reserve 10 Year now stands among only a few that proudly fit this bill. While it might not be considered readily-available in all parts of the country, Eagle Rare 10 Year is probably the best direct comparison offered by another distillery. It comes in at the same age, proof, and approximately the same MSRP. By comparison, Russell’s Reserve 10 Year offers the more quintessential flavor profile, resting on caramel, vanilla, and aged oak notes as opposed to the more fruit-forward flavor profile found in Eagle Rare. Eagle Rare 10 Year is also offered as a single barrel via store selections, and while the standard release isn't labelled as a single barrel it's effectively bottled that way using a continuous barrel-by-barrel bottling line, so sometimes you'll find gems and other times duds.

Within Wild Turkey’s regularly available bourbons, Russell’s Reserve 10 Year has the highest age but one of the lowest proofs. This distinction allows the nuances of higher aged Wild Turkey bourbon to be showcased in a more delicate way. And because it’s batched, Russell's Reserve 10 Year is presumably more consistent as compared to Russell’s Reserve Single Barrel and Wild Turkey Kentucky Spirit. Because Wild Turkey’s regularly available bourbons all originate from the same mashbill, a low barrel entry proof, and fall within a relatively tight age band, variations between them are arguably more nuanced than variations among bourbons offered by some of Kentucky’s other big distilleries. With that being said, Russell’s Reserve 10 Year still finds its place within the Wild Turkey lineup offering an experience that’s different enough from the others to make it worthwhile.","I almost hate to admit it, but this was the first bottle of Russell’s Reserve 10 Year I have ever purchased. This fact surprised me, as it carries a high age statement, it’s readily-available in my area for around $35, and I generally like Wild Turkey’s products. In the past, I have been much more likely to purchase Russell’s Reserve Single Barrel or Wild Turkey 101 which are staples for any bourbon collection, followed by Rare Breed and Kentucky Spirit on occasion. Because Wild Turkey bourbons draw a relatively narrow band across proof, price, and even (arguably) flavor profile, why not pay a little less for Wild Turkey 101 or a little more for Russell’s Reserve Single Barrel? Russell’s Reserve Single Barrel can be found for around $55 in my area, and I know it to be generally in the 8-10 year old range. Additionally, it comes in at 110 proof which is a full 20 proof points higher than Russell’s Reserve 10 Year making it a more full-flavored affair. On the other end, Wild Turkey 101 is robust and quite versatile at its 101 proof and for less than $25.

But there is a place for Russell’s Reserve 10 Year, and it’s probably better compared to Eagle Rare 10 Year when it comes to value. Coming in at a similar MSRP, on paper Eagle Rare 10 Year is generally revered as a tremendous value. As a result it's difficult or impossible to find in some areas, and upcharged in others. By comparison, the two bourbons taste quite a bit different, but are of similar quality. But Russell's Reserve 10 Year is quite a bit easier to find, and as a result presents not only a great value, it's lurking right in front of our eyes.","Russell's Reserve 10 Year may not be the most talked about Wild Turkey bourbon, but it offers a tremendous value for those seeking a higher-aged and lower-proof bourbon from one of the nation's best distilleries.","Wild Turkey offers less in the range of bourbons than other big Kentucky distilleries, largely because they use only one bourbon mashbill and their distillate enters the barrel well under the maximum 125 proof required by law. However, each of their products offers something unique, and Russell's Reserve 10 Year is no exception. Just as importantly, it's readily-available and typically found within range of its MSRP. While it’s not often cited as people's favorite Wild Turkey product, it's a must-have for anyone seeking a traditional higher-aged, lower-proof sipping bourbon.",Nick,3,3.5,3,3,4,3,https://www.breakingbourbon.com/review/russells-reserve-10-year-bourbon
,Russell’s Reserve Single Barrel Rye,Classification: Straight Rye,Company: Campari Group,Distillery: Wild Turkey,Release Date: Ongoing,Proof: 104,Age: NAS,"Mashbill: 51% Rye, 37% Corn, 12% Malted Barley",Color: Copper,Price: $60 (2020),Official Website,"Russell’s Reserve Single Barrel Rye is part of Wild Turkey’s Russell’s Reserve line named in honor of Jimmy and Eddie Russell, the father-son master distiller team that have a combined tenure at Wild Turkey in excess of 100 years. Russell’s Reserve Single Barrel Rye is a single barrel rye whiskey that is hand-selected. Unlike Russell’s Reserve 6 Year Rye, the Single Barrel Rye doesn’t feature an age statement. Like all of Wild Turkey’s rye whiskeys, it’s made from their single rye mashbill.","A straightforward and somewhat unimpressive aroma out of the gate. Faint notes of gingerbread and hay work well against the aroma’s heavier caramel and rye grain scents. There isn't anything flawed about its composition except for the fact that it doesn’t leave much of an impression at all. A forceful swirl of the glass helps open up the aroma by bringing out more of its caramel notes, but the nose is just not as intense as it should be.","An enjoyable display of classic rye notes are present with the notable omission of cinnamon. Its rye grain, caramel, and kettle corn notes don’t reinvent the wheel, but they perform well together. Its most noteworthy trait is a veil of creaminess that envelopes the palate bringing forth a delicious lemon note. Overall it’s an easy sipper that isn’t all that challenging, leaning towards a straightforward delivery of flavors.","A mildly dry, oaky, and caramel aftertaste rides this whiskey to completion. Mid-finish some interchangeably sweet and spicy notes pop in the form of cherry, lemon cookie, and rye spice flavors. They don’t stick around for very long, but are welcomed and help elevate this finish a notch. Its heat carries with you as does its overall dryness.","The Russells are known for their love for bourbon and the passion they put behind their bourbon making. They also aren’t shy about their feelings towards rye whiskey either. A whiskey maker having a favorite type of whiskey isn’t the same as having a favorite child, and the Russells don’t hold back from letting you know they prefer bourbon above rye. Wild Turkey has been making rye for over a half a century, but it still comes off as an afterthought for the company and doesn’t receive as equal footing as their bourbon. It’s hard to say with certainty if this lack of attention trickles down directly affecting the quality of their rye, but it’s safe to say that Wild Turkey rye doesn’t stand toe to toe with their bourbon.

That’s not to say Russell’s Reserve rye whiskey doesn’t have traits that make it stand out from other ryes on the market. Its lemon, slight cherry aftertaste, and its more heavy-handed oakiness helps to define it, but it also doesn’t feel like that’s quite enough either. It lacks a certain amount of wow factor despite its overall quality. With the flood of young rye whiskeys hitting the market that might not be able to directly compete with the Russell’s distilling prowess and time in the barrel, many are offering something Russell’s Reserve ryes struggle with: making a lasting impression.

Of course the Russells might be crafting their rye not with the intention of unique flavors and capturing that quintessential rye flavor profile, but somewhere in between. They’ve succeeded in that regard, but the flip side of that is Russell’s Reserve Rye isn’t exciting enough and doesn’t drive me to want to buy another either. Not every bottle of whiskey has to shock and awe, but I expect more out of a $60 bottle than what it offers.","With the introduction of the Russell’s Reserve line, Wild Turkey seeked to introduce premium versions of their bourbons and rye that was said to have been more carefully curated than their more budget-friendly standard bottles. That is definitely the case with their bourbon, which Wild Turkey has a keen tongue for.

On the rye side, that is a little more precarious. There is a clear-as-day quality difference between Wild Turkey 101 Rye and Russell’s Reserve Single Barrel Rye. $60 is a lot for any whiskey and that price point comes with a certain amount of expectations. While it struggles to completely justify its $60 price, it’s noticeably better than many of the rye whiskeys priced below it. That’s to be expected, but not always a guarantee of course. Within its price range, Russell’s Reserve Single Barrel Rye is mainly up against the inferior Bulleit Rye 12 Year and superior Pikesville Rye, both of which are slightly cheaper. Because of this, Russell’s Reserve Single Barrel Rye struggles to justify its price, and straddles the doesn't-quite-offer-enough line rather perilously.","Russell’s Reserve Single Barrel Rye brings with it a certain level of quality that’s highlighted by its creaminess and oakiness, but still struggles to make a lasting impression.  ","When I cracked open my bottle of Russell’s Reserve Single Barrel Rye I wasn’t immediately impressed. Where at first sip this whiskey was lackluster at best, over a short period of time the whiskey began to open up. The more I sipped it against Wild Turkey 101 Rye and their limited edition rye, 2019’s Cornerstone, I began to understand the quality progression of Wild Turkey’s rye portfolio.

As a whole, the company still has room for improvement regarding all of their rye whiskeys. Russell’s Reserve Single Barrel Rye is a solid pour in the end, and it stands up well to its competitors in its price range, but they’re just not quite there yet with their ryes like they are with their bourbons. Being a single barrel, variation will occur and I don’t doubt there are some spectacular ones. I look forward to Wild Turkey’s continued evolution of their rye whiskey. This Russell’s Reserve Single Barrel Rye may not have wowed me, but the Russell’s continued tooling of the ryes certainly does.",Eric,2.5,3,3,3,2,3,https://www.breakingbourbon.com/review/russells-reserve-single-barrel-rye
,Sazerac Rye,Classification: Straight Rye,"Company: Sazerac Company, Inc.",Distillery: Buffalo Trace,Release Date: Ongoing,Proof: 90,Age: NAS,"Mashbill: Undisclosed (Buffalo Trace’s Low Rye, Rye Mashbill)",Color: Rose Gold,Price: $30 (2020),Official Website,"Sazerac Rye is produced by Sazerac Company, Inc. at Buffalo Trace Distillery. Sazerac is headquartered in New Orleans, and was founded in the 1800’s. According to the company, it started with the cocktail, then the bar, then the company. Antoine Peychaud, a Creole immigrant, would mix brandy, absinthe, and bitters he created at his pharmacy located in the French Quarter. The cocktail became popular at the city’s “coffee houses,” which was the term used for drinking establishments at the time. Peychaud’s concoction became most strongly associated with one coffee house in particular, the Sazerac Coffee House located on Exchange Alley. The coffee house’s owner, Sewell Taylor, institutionalized the drink by using only Sazerac de Forge et Fils brandy, which he imported to the U.S. and sold exclusively. This cocktail earned its name as a result. Thomas H. Handy acquired the Sazerac Coffee House in 1869, and then Peychaud’s bitters in 1873. Thereafter in the 1890s, his company bottled and marketed the Sazerac cocktail, which is now made with rye whiskey as opposed to brandy. C.J. O’Reilly, Handy’s secretary, chartered the Sazerac Company.

Sazerac Rye Whiskey is released in two variations, a limited 18 year old release and ongoing no-age statement release. The limited release is an 18 year old released annually as part of the Buffalo Trace Antique Collection. The ongoing release is aged for at least 4 years, and at one time was said to be approximately 6 years old.","Aromas of orange zest, clove, and raisin greet the senses, with hints of rye spice and anise underneath. It’s soft with a gentle delivery, allowing a deeper inhale to draw out the fainter scents. Quite pleasant overall and a nice way to start the sip.","Fruit flavors comprised of sweet apricots, orange peel, and plums meet more traditional notes of caramel and vanilla. Light barrel char teases in the background, along with a mix of raisin and anise underneath. It has a light body, and at 90 proof, requires a bit of searching to pull out all the flavors. With that being said, the reward is worth the effort.","Rye spice bursts forth, but only momentarily. A light black licorice note follows, but is quickly overtaken by a spicy-sweet blend of dark fruit, caramel, and black pepper. It’s medium-length and invites you back for more.","While Buffalo Trace does not disclose mashbills, the mashbill used to make Sazerac Rye Whiskey is their low rye mashbill, which is believed to be comprised of approximately 51% rye, 39% corn, and 10% malted barley. Other Buffalo Trace distilled brands using the same mashbill include Sazerac 18 Year, Thomas H. Handy, and Van Winkle Family Reserve Rye.

Sazerac Rye is often referred to as “Baby Saz,” as it shares the same general name, proof, and mashbill as Sazerac 18 Year, which is included in Buffalo Trace’s annual Buffalo Trace Antique Collection (BTAC) release. However, Sazerac Rye is much younger - while it has never carried an age statement, at one point it was marketed by Buffalo Trace as 6 years old, and from its classification of “straight rye” we can infer it’s at least 4 years old.

Notably, Thomas H. Handy is another bottle included in the annual BTAC release that uses the same mashbill, and incidentally is aged for approximately the same amount of time as Sazerac Rye, which is typically about 6 years. The main difference between Sazerac and Thomas H. Handy is the proof, as Thomas H. Handy is released at barrel proof. To that end, Thomas H. Handy also shares a similar flavor profile, albeit far more robust and in-your-face given its higher proof.

Broadening the spectrum of rye options beyond those mentioned above, there are an increasing number to choose from though not nearly as many as there are bourbons. Sazerac Rye succeeds in offering a sweet, fruit-forward flavor profile complemented by a rye spice pop that develops in the finish. While others do the same, there is certainly enough variation among brands to leave room to allow Sazerac Rye’s subtle attributes to shine through.","In contrast with sub-$30 bourbon options, there are far fewer rye options on the shelf. Sazerac Rye was introduced over 10 years ago, and for a time there were very few comparable ryes. More recently, we’ve seen a rye resurgence resulting in new rye introductions. Popular options falling in the same general price range include Old Forester Rye ($23), Rittenhouse Rye Bottled-in-Bond ($25), George Dickel Rye ($25), Jack Daniel’s Tennessee Rye ($27), Elijah Craig Rye ($30),  Woodford Reserve Distiller’s Select Rye ($38), High West Double Rye ($39), and Knob Creek Rye ($40). They offer a wide variation of flavor profiles and styles across the rye whiskey category. Given that Sazerac Rye falls on the lower side of the price range and arguably higher side of overall quality, it’s easy to see that at $30 Sazerac Rye is a better than fair deal.","From its simple throwback bottle design to approachable flavor profile and better than fair price, Sazerac Rye is an essential rye for everyone’s whiskey collection.","Sazerac Rye is Sazerac Company’s namesake whiskey, though without a reminder of that fact it may not be top of mind as the Sazerac Company name seems to have little market impact, with marketing instead focused on “Buffalo Trace” and other specific brands within the space. Moreover, the storied Sazerac cocktail is one of the more popular cocktails among bourbon enthusiasts, and Sazerac Rye makes for a suitable backbone for the drink. Baby Saz, as fans lovingly refer to it, is an essential rye whiskey that has stood the test of time from its initial release over 10 years ago. Given its approachable flavor profile and $30 price tag, it's absolutely a whiskey to include on anyone's must-have list.",Nick,3,3,3,3,3.5,3,https://www.breakingbourbon.com/review/sazerac-rye

A single barrel version of this is available and appropriately named OSB Single Barrel. It’s also available by private selection and is typically seen with an 8 year handwritten age statement. The Single Barrel is bottled at barrel proof, which typically ranges from 109 to 118 proof. Alternatively, the company also produces a 10 year old bourbon (Old Scout 10), however it’s not just aged longer but also has a different mashbill consisting of 75% corn, 21% rye, and 4% malt. Due to the rapid and unanticipated growth Smooth Ambler experienced in 2015, the company states that Old Scout 7 and 10 Year Old Bourbon will be ""indefinitely suspended"" from their portfolio.","Caramel, vanilla, and pipe tobacco pull through a thin layer of alcohol. The scents are subtle and not particularly inviting.","Chewy pipe tobacco and burnt wood are rounded out by chocolate and a hint of cherry fruit. There’s a nice, distinctive earthy quality that really comes forward in the sip, and I just can’t help thinking how well this might pair with a cigar.","A bit of spice pops right away along with an astringency that’s a little out of place. This fades quickly and leaves you with the chocolatey, earthy, burnt wood flavors from the palate. Oddly it starts bad and ends good, leaving some really nice flavors behind.","John Little and Tag Galyean established Smooth Ambler in 2009. Like David Perkins did with High West, they decided to source some of their whiskey so they could offer some reasonably aged bottlings along with in-house distilled offerings. Not surprisingly, these are sourced from MGP in Indiana. MGP distills a good deal of what we see on the shelves under many names, however the end product is always a little different. In this case we don’t really have anything unique on paper, but what we do have is a flavor profile that has an earthy quality I just don’t come across that often. Lucky for us, the folks at Smooth Ambler certainly know how to select barrels with a nice flavor profile.","At $39 this is not priced to fly off the shelves, but it’s not greedy either. Smooth Ambler is a newer company and could have easily marketed this as a craft bourbon for $60 or more. Fortunately they didn’t, and their pricing is spot on as a result. Moreover, the pricing combined with their honesty of the bourbon’s origin has earned them my trust.","Good bourbon, good price, interesting company. I’m excited to see what else Smooth Ambler has in store.","It’s refreshing to pay a reasonable price for a bourbon I had little expectation for and be surprised by relatively good quality, a unique flavor profile, and a company with a solid story to back it up. At around $39 it’s definitely worth buying a bottle as Old Scout represents hand-selected sourced bottles much like you may have experienced with some of Willett’s bottlings. The underlying earthy quality of this bourbon really resonated with me, as I find it fairly unique in its overall profile and quite enjoyable. Be sure to check out our write-up of a private selection bottle of Old Scout (barrel proof, 8 years old), which takes the good qualities of this standard release to a whole new level.",Nick,2,3,3.5,3,2.5,3,https://www.breakingbourbon.com/review/smooth-ambler-old-scout-7-year-bourbon
,1792 Aged Twelve Years (1792 12 Year),Classification: Straight Bourbon,Company: Sazerac Company Inc.,Distillery: Barton 1792 Distillery,Release Date: July 2019 (Released annually),Proof: 96.6,Age: 12 Years,"Mashbill: Undisclosed (Marketed as “High rye,” and believed to be 15-25% rye)",Color: Rusty Gold  ,MSRP: $50 (2019),Official Website,"1792 Small Batch is Barton’s flagship bourbon. Having undergone naming changes over the years from 1792 Ridgewood Reserve, to 1792 Ridgemont Reserve, and finally to 1792 Small Batch. The brand once featured an 8 year age statement found on the back of the bottle, but was removed in late 2013. Not long after, the bottle design was updated in conjunction with the change to 1792 Small Batch. With this change, a substantial line extension took place that included 1792 Sweet Wheat, 1792 Port Finish, 1792 Single Barrel, 1792 Full Proof, and 1792 High Rye. In July 2019, 1792’s age statement returned, now aged 12 years with an MSRP of $50. One batch of 1792 Aged Twelve Years will be released each summer. For more background, check out the company’s press release.","Traditional bourbon notes of vanilla and caramel are plentiful, with toffee and honey providing an additional layer of sweetness. Oak is also present, but gentle in its assertiveness. Overall mild in complexity and intensity, the nose is quite enjoyable, but plays it safe.","Walnut, toasted oak, and rye spice produce a bold front to the flavor profile. Much of the sweetness the nose hinted at has disappeared on the palate. Almost immediately you can feel the dryness of the bourbon hit your tongue. Without much sweetness to help balance this, the bourbon is a bit one-sided and certainly doesn’t hide its age.","Quite dry, with ample amounts of oak and bitter tannins throughout the medium length finish. Mild caramel and nutty notes come forth, but are devoid of any sweetness. It has some heat that ramps up in the finish, further amplifying its oakiness which leaves a rather dry aftertaste.","Once upon a time, 1792 Small Batch featured an 8 year age statement and we were big fans of this iteration. It offered a good balance of age and youth compounded by bold flavors and ample oak. We were sad to see it go in 2013, as the new no age statement 1792 Small Batch is much more straightforward, and as a result less interesting despite being very drinkable.

Since then, Barton has released a slew of unique variations of 1792, with Sweet Wheat and Port Finish rating highest. We’re continuously impressed by 1792 single barrel selections, some of which completely took us by surprise with their flavor profiles and extreme drinkability.

Age statements have been slowly returning (Heaven Hill Bottled-in-Bond 7 Year, Knob Creek Small Batch 9 Year), and others remain steadfast (Henry McKenna 10 Year, Eagle Rare 10 Year), yet outside of limited releases they are, for the most part, few and far between. For Barton’s latest 1792 release, the bourbon itself may not be overly unique, but it’s the bourbon’s 12 year age statement that will draw attention. What was once common is now unique. How unique will depend on how long you’ve been around bourbon, but at this moment in time, it’s uncommon to see a 12 year age statement.","It was to be expected that after removing age statements, distilleries would return them one day, except pricing these “new” products at higher point. Barton could have easily returned 1792 Small Batch’s original age statement of 8 years and charged $50. This probably would have been met with some contention as a single digit age statement just doesn’t seem that impressive anymore, despite a world with few age statements. Yet, $50 for a 12 year old bourbon is quite acceptable in today’s marketplace and maintains 1792’s value pricing that they’ve long been known for. For its 2019 batch, the additional aging time didn’t do much to improve the base product, and in more than a few ways, probably harmed it. In fact, the product reminds me of what a lot of age stated bourbons used to taste like earlier this decade: Oaky, serviceable, and more times than not, just average. On paper, $50 in today’s marketplace is a great value for a 12 year old bourbon. I just wish this 12 year old 1792 bourbon was a little bit better to make it an even greater value.","The return of a 1792 age statement is commendable, but its lack of sweetness against heavy oak and dryness makes the product come up short.","We seem to have moved past the period of brands removing age statements and entered into a period of them returning, but at a higher price than before. At least in 1792’s case, its age statement returned not at 8 years, but 12 years. I can see how that might help justify its new higher price, but it certainly didn’t make it a better bourbon because of it. It’s a bolder bourbon, with heavy rye spice and oakiness, but its lack of sweetness makes it unbalanced. Don’t get me wrong, it’s great seeing 1792 with an age statement again, but this particular brand might be better served with a slightly lower one as proven in the past. You can have a lot of fun tasting all of the variations in the 1792 portfolio, but the age old stereotype that older bourbon is better - at least in this case - is debunked here.

It’s worth keeping in mind though, the 1792 brand doesn't necessarily strive to be the best bourbon on the shelf. It’s a steadfast middle-of-the-road bourbon presented at a great value and that is once again true here. 1792 Aged Twelve Years is a curiosity, and while Barton should be commended for returning to an age stated bourbon, the product in its current state just isn’t reaching the potential I believe it has.

In Depth Review,1792 Bottled in Bond,Straight Bourbon,Sazerac Company Inc.,Barton 1792 Distillery,"One batch will be released each fall, beginning in 2017",100,NAS,"Undisclosed (Marketed as “High rye,” and believed to be 15-25% rye)",Dark Honey,$36 (2018),,"To be labelled Bottled in Bond, the whiskey must be the product of one distillation season and one distiller at a single distillery, aged in a federally bonded warehouse under U.S. government supervision for at least four years, and it must be bottled at exactly 100 proof. Additionally, the Bottled in Bond label must clearly identify the distillery where it was distilled and where it was bottled, if different. ","Rye spice, vanilla, and caramel are most prominent with a trace of oak underneath. The scents are oddly a bit light, lacking the anticipated dose of ethanol I would expect for 100 proof. Enjoyable overall.","Rye spice mingles with caramel and vanilla creating a flavor profile that’s easily alluded to based on the aroma. There’s a developed amount of seasoned oak as well, giving it much needed dimension. The rye spice and seasoned oak present themselves most prominently, overtaking the sweeter notes, which ultimately makes for a characteristically spicy sip. It’s not quite as chewy as compared to 1792 Small Batch, but it does have a nice mouthfeel overall.","The sip ends nicely with rye spice and seasoned oak dominating the start of the finish. There’s a hint of caramel sweetness as well, providing a sweeter note to contrast the more overpowering spice found in the finish. Medium to long lasting.","To draw a comparison to 1792 Bottled in Bond, you don’t need to look very far. In fact, Barton makes two very similar products - 1792 Small Batch and Very Old Barton Bottled In Bond. 1792 Small Batch is Barton’s flagship product, released year round and easily accessible. Presumably the same mashbill, the only difference we can identify with certainty is the proof - 100 for Bottled In Bond versus Small Batch’s fairly close 93.7. Both labels require a minimum age of 4 years, and while the Bottled In Bond must be the product of one distillation season we can’t say with certainty Small Batch isn’t. With that in mind, however, it wouldn’t be unreasonable to believe barrels of varying ages (and as a result distillation seasons) are mingled together to create Small Batch. It also wouldn’t be unreasonable to assume Bottled In Bond is more carefully curated as barrels from a single distillation season are more carefully selected prior to batching. But then again, these are just assumptions. What might be an even closer product, or maybe even the same, is Barton’s own Very Old Barton Bottled In Bond. It once came with a 6 year age statement but that has been removed in favor of a no age statement (NAS) version. My best guess is that this is most likely released in the 4-5 year old range, however we don’t know for sure. Bargain priced and bottled in less “premium” looking packaging than 1792 Bottled In Bond, it’s possible the two products are identical in every way except for their labels. To compare, I lined up all three and tasted them. I’ll note that each had been open for some time with a fair amount of air space in the bottle (including the 1792 Bottled In Bond), though the 1792 Bottled In Bond was in a small media sample bottle. The Very Old Barton was the most potent and also most rough around the edges, but with that it also demonstrated the most character. Due to its lower proof 1792 Small Batch was the least potent, but not by much. What it allowed for was more of the flavors to pull through, and for whatever reason had the best mouthfeel of the three. 1792 Bottled in Bond kind of split the difference. It offered more potency and spice than 1792 Small Batch, but wasn’t quite as potent and rough around the edges as Very Old Barton. Most notably, the three were only marginally different, and I think all things considered it would come down to merely personal preference in deciding which was the favorite.



","At more than double the price of Very Old Barton Bottled In Bond and a 45% premium over 1792 Small Batch, you could easily argue 1792 Bottled In Bond is a terrible value. In many ways I would agree with that. However, outside of that comparison I can’t ignore the fact that Barton is introducing a new Bottled in Bond bourbon to the market and charging $36 for it - not necessarily a steal but really not a deal breaking price tag as far as I’m concerned. Considering the fact that Barton only plans to release it once a year in the fall, I would assume it will serve to showcase particular batches, by distillation season of course, that they feel offer something a bit more special than their standard Small Batch release. Since it’s more well rounded than Very Old Barton Bottled In Bond by my comparison, I would also assume they intend it to be a more refined product. To that end, while it isn’t a must have bourbon at a must have price, it is reasonably priced overall.","While 1792 Bottled In Bond is a very similar product to other existing Barton products, what it does offer is something just unique enough to capture my interest.","Depending how you look at it Barton could receive accolades or criticism for this release. It’s great to see them releasing a new Bottled in Bond bourbon, but considering it’s so similar to their existing products, and at a much higher price by comparison, it’s easy to dismiss it. All considered, it’s still only $36 and at that price I’m not looking for magic - a little different than what else is out there is good enough as long as it’s a decent bourbon. This one is, and it serves to showcase what the distillery can do along with highlighting a significant milestone for the industry, and our country as a whole - the Bottled in Bond Act of 1897. If the folks at Barton are listening, it would be really nice to see some more information on the label - the age, distillation season, where exactly it was aged in the rickhouse, etc. Considering the additional premium, the fact that the Bottled in Bond Act called for additional product disclosure, and the fact that this will be released each year, it would be nice to know a little more about what exactly is inside the bottle so that bourbon geeks like me can more fully get behind this product.",Nick,2.5,3,2.5,3,2.5,2.5,https://www.breakingbourbon.com/review/1792-bottled-in-bond
In Depth Review,1792 High Rye,Straight Bourbon,Sazerac Company Inc.,Barton 1792 Distillery,October 2016,94.3,NAS,Undisclosed,Copper,$36 (2016),,"This is the fifth brand extension in the 1792 portfolio, along with Full Proof, Sweet Wheat, Port Finish, and Single Barrel. While no mashbill is disclosed, this is described as a high rye bourbon. According to the company’s press release, the bourbon was distilled in May 2008, and aged a little over 8 years on the second floor of Warehouse K at the Barton 1792 Distillery. Although initially released in limited numbers, Barton plans to release this annually.","Light is the name of the game with this nose. Noticeable light scents of orange, banana peels, vanilla, toasted marshmallows, and oak. There is also the slightest hint of ethanol. The scents presented while unassuming, are subtly sweet and attractive enough to please most.","For being labeled a high rye bourbon, this is sweeter than expected. This isn’t necessarily a bad thing, as the light traces of black pepper and rye grain play nicely with sweet dried apples and caramel. No flavor dominates the others, but none is a true standout either.","The subtlest trace of heat starts the finish, which is composed heavily of pepper and rye spice. It’s not as dominant as other high rye bourbons, but it’s noticeable enough. As the finish goes on, the flavors morph from pepper and rye into a tasty lingering sweet pear flavor with a tad of oak and a smidge of white pepper.","1792 has been on a roll lately with their “limited expression” series. Each one has been a nice play on the standard 1792 Small Batch Bourbon, with this release of High Rye being no exception. While others in the series have presented more of a bold contrast in comparison, this still offers a nice, albeit small variation from the standard expression. If you’re a rye drinker looking for a bourbon that embodies more of rye’s qualities, this isn’t it. However, if you’re a fan of 1792 Small Batch and want a subtle variation, then you’ll appreciate what High Rye has to offer.","The great thing about Barton’s “limited expressions” of their 1792 series, is the fact that they’ve kept prices low. While other distilleries continue to release limited editions with ever increasing prices, Barton has kept this series low in price for anyone to enjoy. This holds true for High Rye, as it comes in at just over $35. While this bourbon isn’t setting any new standards for a high rye bourbon, it’s commendable that Barton doesn’t overcharge for what is just an average bourbon. Compared to the competition, it’s priced right. However it’s not just other distilleries that it’s competing for attention against, but also the others in the 1792 lineup. With that in mind, even though it’s only priced $5-$10 more than the standard 1792 Small Batch, it still doesn’t offer a huge flavor profile difference to justify the increase either.","Sweeter than expected for a high rye expression, 1792 High Rye delivers a nice tasting experience at a very reasonable price point, but is dangerously average.","Based on the flavor profile presented in 1792 High Rye, I’m surprised Barton chose to get behind the idea of marketing this as “High Rye.” This is especially poignant in this case, since their standard 1792 Small Batch Bourbon is already stated to be a “high rye” bourbon. Part of the issue is that we do not know how much more rye is in this mashbill versus the standard 1792 Small Batch. Is it only 1% more or is it 20% more? Taste alone would lead me to believe it’s only a few percentage points at most, since I found this to be slightly sweeter when compared to the standard 1792 expression. That said, the flavor profile offers a nice experience and enough of a variation compared to the standard 1792 Small Batch Bourbon. In comparison to its siblings, I’d say it’s the weakest of the 1792 limited expressions, and yet it’s still not a bad bourbon by any means. While there are much better bourbons that can be found in this price point overall, this offers a subtle yet nice twist to the 1792 portfolio. What High Rye lacks for in wow factor, it makes up for in the fact that it’s a limited release product that is priced below the competition. And that’s the saving grace of this bourbon. While not a substantial improvement over 1792 Small Batch, Barton recognizes what it is and has priced it accordingly. I wish more distilleries would take note and accurately charge for what’s in the bottle and not overcharge just because it’s a limited product. You may not be blown away by it, but you also won’t be left a ton in the hole for giving it a shot either.

,1792 Small Batch,Classification: Straight Bourbon,Company: Sazerac Company Inc.,Distillery: Barton 1792 Distillery,Released: Ongoing,Proof: 93.7,Age: NAS,"Mashbill: Undisclosed (Marketed as “High rye,” and believed to be 15-25% rye)",Color: Honey,MSRP: $25 (2017),Official Website,"1792 Small Batch is Barton’s flagship bourbon. Having undergone naming changes over the years from 1792 Ridgewood Reserve, to 1792 Ridgemont Reserve, and finally to 1792 Small Batch, the brand has maintained its position as a sub-$30 bourbon that’s bold in character. While still branded as 1792 Ridgemont Reserve, the 8 year age statement found on the back of the bottle was removed in late 2013. Not long after, the bottle design was updated in conjunction with the change to 1792 Small Batch. With this change, a substantial line extension took place that included 1792 Sweet Wheat, 1792 Port Finish, 1792 Single Barrel, 1792 Full Proof, and 1792 High Rye. It’s unknown which of those will become permanent line extensions, if any.","Rye spice, vanilla, and caramel pull through an undertone of ethanol. A trace of oak lingers underneath. The potency of the ethanol suggests a higher proof than it is, and overall the aroma is unrefined. It doesn’t invite me in for a sip, but doesn’t quite deter me either.","There’s little subtlety here. Rye spice along with sweet vanilla and caramel solidify their presence leaving no other flavors hiding underneath. The mouthfeel is satisfying, as the bourbon is slightly more chewy than average. Like the nose, the potency of the palate also suggests a higher proof than it is. More notably, it comes across as a bit rough around the edges with a sort of “sweet versus spice” effect in the sense that the contrasting bold flavors seem to be more in competition with one another than complementing one another. This gives it a dose of character that some may love, while others may hate.","Rye spice, vanilla, and caramel present themselves again in the medium length finish. Spice leads the charge, while the sweeter flavors take over as the flavors decay. Dark fruit makes a brief appearance, but it’s alongside the general “sweet” note.","1792 Ridgemont Reserve was my go-to bourbon for a long time, and that was when it was packaged differently and had an 8 year age statement that no one took notice of. The age statement was on the back of the bottle, and based on consumers’ attention to bourbon at the time it didn’t matter. 8 years, 10 years, 12 years, even 18 years...they were just numbers on bottles and they were plentiful. 1792 was a bourbon that I grew with. It was a bourbon that I had with ice cubes. Then one ice cube. Then a few drops of water. Then neat. It was there for my transition from a casual bourbon drinker to something more. But time has passed and I can’t look at it through the same lens I once did. And even if I could, it’s no longer the same. Compared side by side to its 8 year old predecessor the differences are clear. The 8 year old has more depth, more character, and more flavor. But that doesn’t change what’s in the bottle today. 1792 is still what it’s expected to be, and basically what Barton’s marketing says it is - a bourbon that’s brash and bold, yet smooth and balanced. Well almost, because it’s not necessary smooth in the sense of the term. So while it lacks the depth it once had, it still manages to distinguish itself from other bourbons in the price range by offering enough character to make it interesting.","At under $30, it’s difficult to say a bourbon is a bad deal. Barton has released a variety of bourbons, all priced at a bargain for what they are. But 1792 Small Batch is always on the shelves just about everywhere and seems like it’s rarely talked about in the community, so it isn’t necessarily perceived as a stellar deal. Not to mention there are better bourbons in the price range - Wild Turkey 101 and the slightly more expensive Henry McKenna Single Barrel, for example. But, if it’s your jam, 1792 Small Batch is a staple in the sub-$30 price range, plain and simple. If you haven’t tried it yet pick up a bottle and give it a go.","1792 Small Batch is a straightforward bourbon with a heavy dose of character, making it a solid pour in the price range despite its otherwise simple flavor profile.","1792 Small Batch isn’t a great bourbon, but it still offers character within its price range where many other bourbons seem to be blending together into an indistinguishable mob. It lacks the depth of its 8 year age stated predecessor, but the comparison is a moot point. Compared to what’s on the shelves right now in the price range, it offers enough of a unique experience to make it worthy of your attention. And its character is both a gift and curse - some will like it enough to make it a staple in their bar while others may downright hate it. But it’s $25, so c’mon already.

,Angel’s Envy Bourbon Port Finish,Classification: Straight Bourbon Finished in Port Wine Barrels,Company: Bacardi Limited,Distillery: Undisclosed Distillery(ies) in Kentucky,Release Date: Ongoing,Proof: 86.6,Age: NAS,"Mashbill: 72% Corn, 18% Rye, 10% Malted Barley",Color: Copper,MSRP: $50,Official Website,"Angel’s Envy was founded by Wes Henderson, son of late industry icon Lincoln Henderson. Before his passing in 2013, Lincoln worked selecting and blending whiskeys for Angel’s Envy. Angel’s Envy whiskeys made their first appearance in 2011 and we’ve seen three ongoing expressions so far: Cask Strength Bourbon Finished In Port Barrels, Bourbon Finished In Port Barrels, and Rye Finished In Rum Casks. In early 2015 the Angel’s Envy company was acquired by Bacardi Ltd, and in November of 2016 the company opened their Louisville Distilling Company location in downtown Louisville.

Angel’s Envy Port Finish is blended in small batches of 8-12 barrels at a time. The company states that the bourbon is typically aged up to 6 years, and then is finished in ruby port wine casks for an additional 3-6 months. For the finishing process, the company uses 60 gallon ruby port barrels made from French oak which are imported directly from Portugal.","Light oak, vanilla, and the slightest touch of berry jam drift upwards. Mingled in are peanut shells, and a touch of sweet syrup. The bourbon's 86.6 proof is doing it no favors here, as the scents are light, and focus must be honed in to be able to sift through what is present.","Muted vanilla, light oak, and leather swirl together and are joined are dashes of green peppercorn and syrup-soaked raisins. For being finished for 3-6 months, you’d expect more of an impact from the port barrels. However, this isn’t the case. While the flavors present are nice, the mouthfeel is on the thinner side, which detracts from their impact.","Oak, faint hints of rye spice, vanilla, and light berry jam quickly leap up and almost as quickly fade away. Left behind are faint dry oak and a lingering light spice. The combination of flavors is a perfectly fine way to end, and truthfully, is one of the more memorable parts of the sip due to the fading spice. Much like the rest of the sip, it leaves you wanting for just a bit more impact.","Finished bourbons are now commonplace, with varying finishes being experimented and released by an increasing number of companies all time. What was once considered an experiment by many traditional master distillers, has now become a more common creative outlet for them to explore and test their skill set. This mindset and industry norm all changed over a very short period, and in large part, it’s due to the creation of Angel’s Envy.

When Angel’s Envy was originally founded, the company set about with only one product, their Angel’s Envy Port Finish Bourbon. While this was shortly followed by Angel’s Envy Rye and Angel’s Envy Cask Strength Bourbon, Port Finish was somewhat revolutionary at the time. No other bourbon company was putting out a continuous barrel-finished product to American consumers, let alone making their only product, a barrel finished bourbon.

While credit needs to be given to Angel’s Envy for paving the way for barrel finished bourbons to become accepted by whiskey drinkers, since its release, the cottage industry they helped create has slowly surpassed them. While Angel’s Envy Port Finish affords a great sip, its palate isn’t as bold as you see from other bourbons such as Yellowstone's ongoing limited editions, or unique as the ongoing Blood Oath line. Additionally, while not utilizing another used spirit barrel, double barrel bourbons such as Woodford Double Oak or Elijah Craig Toasted Barrel Finish, have also caught on in the pursuing years. This is all a long-winded way of saying that while Angel’s Envy Port Finish is still unique, it’s certainly not as unique as it used to be only a few years ago.","On paper, Angel’s Envy Port Finish is a good value proposition. First and foremost its a ~6 year old bourbon that’s been finished in port barrels for a decent amount of time. Add in an attractive bottle that stands out on store and bar shelves alike, and it presents a promising invitation.

However, the bourbon inside presents a different picture. While I can’t emphasize enough that there is nothing wrong with the sip, I have to point out how average it is overall. It’s positioned as a premium product much like Woodford Reserve or Basil Hayden’s Bourbon, and the end result is much the same. It’s a great bourbon for those looking to explore barrel finished bourbons and want something slightly different from a standard bourbon profile, yet still want to keep the proof below 90. For everyone else, this will be an average at best bourbon when compared to other finished bourbons on the marketplace.","With the recent explosion of barrel finished bourbons over the years, the original king of barrel finishing seems to not quite carry the shine it once did.","Back in 2013, Angel’s Envy was considered a trailblazer. It helped take a cottage industry inside of the bourbon world and make it mainstream. Since that time however, more innovation has taken place and consumers expect more of an impact from their barrel finished products. The company even joined in with their often polarizing, but no doubt impactful, Angel’s Envy Rye, which is finished in used Caribbean rum barrels.

Angel’s Envy Port Finish isn’t a bad bourbon. Instead it plays in the world of subtleties. Its entire sip is subtly influenced by the port barrels it is finished in, however its lower 86.6 proof holds the bourbon back from really exemplifying them. Yes the company has their cask finished limited edition annual release, however this often clocks in around a 120 proof. For many that tilts the scale too far. You're left wishing that this was more in line with the 100 proof that Angel’s Envy Rye is bottled at.

If you haven't explored barrel finished bourbons yet, Angel’s Envy Port Finished Bourbon is a good start. It’s not so influenced that you’ll be turned off if you discover you're more of a traditionalist, and if you find that you like it, you’ll have a suitable introduction to a range of barrel finished products to further explore. On top of that, it provides a really nice subtle twist for lower proof cocktails. Credit needs to be given to this trailblazer of a product, however it also needs to be realized that this bourbon leaves you wanting just a bit more.",Jordan,2.5,2.5,3,3,2.5,2.5,https://www.breakingbourbon.com/review/angels-envy-bourbon-port-finish
,Barrell Whiskey Batch 002,Classification: Whiskey,Company: Barrell Craft Spirits,Distillery: Sourced (From an undisclosed distillery in Indiana),Released: April 2016,Proof: 123.8,Age: 9.5 Years,"Mashbill: Undisclosed amounts of Corn, Rye, and Malted Barley",Color:  Golden Straw,MSRP: $60 (2017),Official Website,"This is the second whiskey release from Barrell Craft Spirits. For this offering, they used a 9.5 year old whiskey that was distilled in Indiana and aged in Kentucky in previously used bourbon barrels and then finished in sherry casks. The mashbill for this whiskey consists of corn, rye, and malted barley, however exact ratios are not provided. The bottle being reviewed is #553.","Immediately upon pouring a glass, a noticeable heavy coat of ethanol hangs over the nose of this whiskey and reminds me of its presence every time I inhale. In order to fully enjoy this, I recommend giving this whiskey 5-10 minutes to breathe and let the alcohol dissipate. After giving this time to breathe, I find oak, leather, graham cracker, light vanilla, and dried figs. The flavors play nicely enough, however the initial upfront and lingering alcohol scent does a disservice to the nose, muting its overall potential.","After the nose, it should come as no surprise that this palate drinks to its proof, bringing an ample yet still manageable amount of heat. Light in mouthfeel, the palate consists of a hit of sweet vanilla upfront immediately followed by aged oak, dry leather, spiced raisins, rye spice, and a hint of creamy sherry from the finishing. Overall, the palate contains a nice mix of flavors and is able to balance out the heat nicely.","The heat carries through from the palate and really unleashes itself in the finish, however it’s contained only in my mouth. The sherry finishing shines through the brightest in the finish, with heavy creamy sherry notes carrying through and dominating the finish upfront. After a while, hints of vanilla and raisins also appear. Eventually the finish dies out into a mix of aged oak, dry nuts, and a remaining hint of creamy sherry, which is nice, but not as pleasant as the first half of the finish.","I am a fan of Barrell Whiskey Batch 001. It’s well balanced with a great flavor profile that drinks below its 122.5 proof. While unique in it’s own right, Batch 002 isn’t as dynamic of an experience for me. Yes this may not be a fair apples to apples comparison and the sherry cask finish imbued a nice flavor profile, however the extra 1.3 proof points adds a noticeable amount of heat, which seems to detract from the overall drinking experience comparatively. Additionally, while the flavors in Batch 002 are very pleasant, to me they do not deliver the rich, delicious flavors found throughout Batch 001.

A fairer comparison would be comparing Batch 002 to other barrel finished whiskeys. While the sherry cask finishing is noticeable, its influence is not as prominent as other barrel finished whiskeys such as Angel’s Envy Rye or High West Double Rye Manhattan Finish. This could be due to the overall length the whiskey spent in the sherry casks, which Barrell Spirits has not disclosed for this release. While I prefer barrel finished bourbons to really highlight the finishing barrel used, others may actually enjoy this due to the subtle nature of how the sherry cask influences the whiskey without completely dominating the flavor profile.

It should be noted that I went back after the review and added a few drops of water as was suggested on Barrell’s website. While the nose remained unchanged, the sherry finishing became more apparent in the palate and finish, along with rye spice poking its way into the finish. Overall I didn’t notice too much of a difference in the flavor profile and would recommend drinking it however you prefer.","A cask strength whiskey just shy of 10 years old that was finished in sherry casks for $60 seems like a great value on paper. In fact compared to other barrel proof whiskeys finished in a second alcohol barrel, this is priced excellently. That said, while the flavor profile is good, I feel like this whiskey doesn’t live up to its truest potential. It almost plays it safe by dampening the influence of the sherry cask finish, which in turn tends to dampen the overall experience.

That’s the thing with Barrell’s products though, you’re never quite sure what you’re going to get. While Batch 001 is priced the same, it felt like I was drinking two whiskeys worlds apart. While it’s unfair and unnecessary to expect Barrell to price different batches based on comparisons to predecessors, consumers need to be aware that the batch variation along with personal taste preferences will dictate value on a batch-by-batch, person-by-person basis.","Finished in sherry casks, Barrell Whiskey Batch 002 is a pleasant whiskey that ultimately seems to fall short of its full potential.","Up until this point, I’ve been a big fan of Barrell and the products they’ve recently brought to the market. Their products remind me of Black Maple Hill in their prime, with founder Joe Beatrice selecting and blending some phenomenal barrels for their bourbon line and doing a great job on Barrel Whiskey 001. While I thought Batch 001 of their whiskey was delicious, Batch 002 doesn’t live up the expectations I had for it.

Aged longer than Batch 001 and finished in sherry casks, all for the same price...this seems like a no brainer in terms of providing a great drinking experience. But that additional aging and finishing is exactly why I thought this didn’t actually live up to expectations. While the flavors that are present are enjoyable, I was surprised that it didn’t present a more complex experience seeing as this was aged in two different previously used barrels for almost 10 years. That’s not to say the flavor profile isn’t good, I just walked away feeling that this could be so much more than what it is.

For most, I’d recommend using your money to seek out a remaining bottle of Barrell Whiskey Batch 001 and trying Batch 002 at the bar if you’re curious to see how this stacks up. While this may not be one that I enthusiastically recommend, if you’re a fan of trying unique one-off market offerings, then you may enjoy Batch 002. And that’s what I find so refreshing about Barrell Spirits. Each batch delivers its own unique one-off drinking experience, which leaves me looking forward to seeing what future releases have to offer.

,Basil Hayden’s Caribbean Reserve Rye,Classification: Distilled Spirits Specialties (8 year old Kentucky Straight Rye Whiskey Blended with 4 year old Canadian Whiskey and Black Strap Rum),Company: Beam Suntory,Distillery: Jim Beam,Release Date: May 2019,Proof: 80,Age: NAS,Mashbill: Undisclosed,Color: Medium Mahogany,MSRP: $45 (2019),Official Website,"Basil Hayden’s Caribbean Reserve Rye is the fourth release in the Basil Hayden’s rye line. This release is made by blending an 8 year old Kentucky rye, 4 year old Canadian rye (Alberta Distillery), and Black Strap Rum together. Read the full Press Release. View the COLA Label Approval Certification.","Sweet rich molasses notes are instantly noticeable and quite dominating. Inhaling deeply reveals trace amounts of oak, vanilla, and random touches of blueberries. Due to the low proof and the fact that the molasses scent is so dominating, it would be hard to discern what this is if handed to you blindly. The nose shows that it’s clearly not rum, but it also doesn’t come across as a rye either. It’s a non-traditional nose that’s surprisingly quite funky and fun.","An overly sweet molasses note hits first and comes across as slightly artificial. Like the nose, molasses dominates, but is now mingled with wet oak, baking spices, and a hint of vanilla. The sip’s mouthfeel is extremely thin, and lacks the sweet mouth coating stickiness that the nose lulled you into believing was coming. The limiting factor in the palate is the artificial taste of the molasses which comes across as more of an additive than what you’d typically find in a barrel finished whiskey - not exactly what I’m looking for when I sip a whiskey.","A simple combination of oak, vanilla, and molasses. The vanilla quickly fades away followed by the oak a little while later. The molasses, however, lightly lingers for an incredibly long time. It’s surprising how long the finish lasts considering this is only an 80 proof whiskey. What the palate lacks, the finish helps end on a higher note.","Like Basil Hayden’s Dark Rye, which Beam Suntory added port directly to the blend, the same is found here, but with rum instead. Some will cry foul, however a traditional rye is not the goal here. Rarely do you see distilleries going this route outside of Beam Suntory.

Additionally, it would be impossible to review this rye without talking about how it compares to Angel’s Envy Rye, which is finished in ex-rum barrels. Angel’s Envy Rye can be quite polarizing. More often than not you’ll find whiskey purists not impressed, while others enjoy seeing how far barrel finishes can be pushed. I’m in the latter camp as I’m always interested to see what barrel finishing can do to a whiskey and I’m a big fan of the resulting flavor profile of Angel’s Envy Rye. To me, Angel’s Envy Rye is the closest thing that you’ll find that could be considered a dessert whiskey (if such a category existed).

So it comes down to how well these two ryes incorporate rum to create unique final products. I’ll come right out and say that Angel’s Envy’s use of rum barrel aging for their rye produces a more distinguishable, well-rounded, and unique product versus adding rum directly to the blend. Basil Hayden’s Caribbean Rye has the potential to hold its own if it wasn’t for the unnaturalness of its palate. What it does do though, is bring a blend of rye and rum that, despite its flaws, many will find appealing due to its sweet and unique palate.","Unlike Angel’s Envy Rye which usually retails around $80 - $90, Basil Hayden’s Caribbean Rye feels like a good value at only $45. While you may not get the full depth that Angel’s Envy Rye offers, you get a slightly lesser product that still delivers a sweet rum influenced flavor profile for those who enjoy this type of marriage of flavors. Basil Hayden’s Caribbean Rye’s 80 proof sippability and low price make this an ideal alternative to those who are looking for something different, but don’t want to break the bank.","Basil Hayden’s Caribbean Rye has some misses like its lower proof and slightly artificial tasting palate, however the sweet molasses found throughout, combined with a fair price, make it hard to discount totally.","Due to the direct addition of rum, Basil Hayden’s Rye comes across exactly like it is - a whiskey that has rum mixed into it. This will be one of those love it or hate it whiskeys. Some will find it too sweet, some not sweet enough, others will be turned off by the entire concept, and some people will think it’s amazing. Sure this could be said about most whiskeys out there, but in this case I have a feeling few people won’t have a strong opinion after trying it.

The addition of rum directly to the mix shows that you can’t beat father time. The inclusion of rum produces a great nose and an enjoyable finish, however it’s clear when you take a sip that the rum was added unnaturally versus barrel finishing it in a rum barrel. It’s enough to bring down all the other good aspects of Basil Hayden’s Caribbean Rum. While I personally would rather have a pour of Angel’s Envy Rye, I also realize that at half the cost, even with the palate being off, this is a good alternative for many. If you’re a fan of Angel’s Envy Rye or you’re interested in how blending rum directly into a rye turns out, let curiosity get the best of you and seek it out.",Jordan,3.5,2,3,3.5,3,2.5,https://www.breakingbourbon.com/review/basil-haydens-caribbean-reserve-rye

The palate has some hints of cinnamon, however it’s liquorice that stands out the most. Some rye spice rounds out the palate. Overall the bourbon has a generally thin mouthfeel. It also has a very noticeable whitedog taste to it. For a bourbon that has an age statement of six years and that also contains some amount of seven and a half year old bourbon, it certainly doesn’t taste like it.","As is the overall norm with this bourbon, earthy notes of pine and grass with liquorice dominate. These notes stay with you for the entirety of the semi-dry, medium length finish.","This is definitely an interesting bourbon. It didn’t have a flavor profile that immediately made me love it, but it had enough curious elements that piqued my interest. Its flavor profile is definitely different than most bourbons, which probably doesn’t make this a great bourbon if you’re new to the spirit. For a seasoned bourbon drinker, Bib & Tucker is going to be a “sorta like it” or “hate it a lot” bourbon. I don’t see it as a bourbon people are going to fall head over heals for. The flavor profile just isn’t at that level. But because of its very unique flavor, some people might be intrigued, while others are going to downright hate it.","At a price of $55 and a flavor profile that can be very polarizing, it’s a pretty costly gamble you’re taking buying this bourbon on the off-chance you’ll like it. The flavor alone will keep this bourbon from being an everyday bourbon, so what you’re hoping to get from this, is something to break out from time to time to mix things up. If this is the case and Bib & Tucker becomes known as a special occasion bourbon, then maybe $55 will become an acceptable price for it.

A premium priced bourbon should also have a bottle that conveys a similar message of “premium.” It makes marketing sense that a unique bourbon needs an equally unique bottle (e.g. Blanton's, E.H. Taylor). Seeing Bib & Tucker’s expertly designed bottle on the shelf screams “buy me.” Seeing the price screams “I’m special.” Together they scream brilliant marketing. After all is said and done, and you take the bourbon at face value, Bib & Tucker simply isn’t a $55 bourbon. It’s an average bourbon in a fancy bottle.",A flavor profile that errs more on the unique side of the spectrum.,"There are a lot of bourbon drinkers that will probably dismiss Bib & Tucker because of its almost too unique flavor profile. It’s odd, but not necessarily downright bad. Despite looking similar to Bulleit’s bottle design, the bourbon inside is the farthest thing from it. Bib & Tucker is a much more challenging bourbon, because it plays with the standard bourbon flavor profile. I really would have like to have seen what a few more years in the barrel would have done to this bourbon. Bib & Tucker would have benefited greatly with more oak notes in its flavor profile.  As is, this is definitely a try-before-you-buy bottle. If you feel like taking a gamble, you might be rewarded with a bourbon that challenges you in the best of ways. Even if you don’t like it, there isn’t a better looking bottle on the market to collect dust.",Eric,2.5,2.5,2.5,4,2,2.5,https://www.breakingbourbon.com/review/bib-tucker-bourbon
,Blade & Bow Bourbon,Classification: Straight Bourbon,Company: Diageo,Distillery: Combination of bourbon distilled by the Stitzel-Weller Distilling Company and other straight bourbons,Released: April 2018,Proof: 91,Age: NAS,Mashbill: Undisclosed,Color:  Light Copper,MSRP: $50 (2018),Official Website,"Blade and Bow is produced at the original site of the iconic Stitzel-Weller Distillery in Louisville, Kentucky. The original distillery closed its doors in 1992, and Diageo reopened the facility in 2014. In regards to the origins of the Blade and Bow name, it represents the two parts of a skeleton key, the blade shaft and the ornate bow. Diageo states that “The Blade and Bow brand is a tribute to the five keys that once hung on the door of the Stitzel-Weller Distillery,” which stands for the five steps of making bourbon - grains, yeast, fermentation, distillation, and aging.

Unlike it’s older brother Blade and Bow 22 Year, the standard No Age Statement (NAS) Blade and Bow is produced by utilizing the solera aging method. According to Diageo, some of the last bourbon produced at Stitzel-Weller is used in their solera system. They state that “Older bourbon from Stitzel-Weller is mingled with other younger whiskies. No barrel is ever fully drained, ensuring the oldest bourbon is always present.”","The nose is light and airy and starts with aromas of peaches, honey, hay, and light oak. These scents are encapsulated within a dose of ethanol, which I wasn’t expecting to be so prominent for a 91 proof bourbon.","The peaches from the nose carry over and are joined with white pepper, vanilla, oak, and a little grain spice. It’s light and enjoyable with a nice balance of sweet and a dash of spice. The palate makes this really easy to sip on.","The finish starts with a spurt of light heat up front that mellows into sweeter notes. The fruit flavor and vanilla carry through and mingle with light oak. They’re further joined by a hint of aged leather at the end. These fade leaving just the oak to man the party, which lingers for longer than expected.","Solera aging is a rarity in the bourbon world. Few distilleries actually use this method due to the intensive labor involved in producing the end product. Additionally, the fact that Blade and Bow utilizes original Stitzel-Weller distillate in their solera process makes this all the more unique.

It should be pointed out however, that while Stitzel-Weller distillate is used in the method, consumers actually have no idea how much ends up in each bottle. In all likelihood, it’s a very miniscule amount. While not a false statement, it feels like more of a marketing ploy than anything. The same can be said about distilling and aging in the Stitzel-Weller Distillery. Yes it’s iconic, but the name alone isn’t what made the older stocks of Stitzel-Weller bourbon so special. It was the skill of the distillers and the ingredients at the time that made the bourbon what it was.","Blade and Bow seems to have all the right ingredients to charge a high price, the Stitzel-Weller name, the Stitzel-Weller location, and the Stitzel-Weller stock, along with a solera aging method. So few distilleries use the solera method to produce bourbon that Diageo is the only large producer utilizing this method. While they may be the largest, that doesn’t mean that their aren’t others utilizing this method. In fact one company we’d reviewed is Hillrock Estate Distillery and their Hillrock Estate Solera Aged Bourbon which retails for $90. In comparison Blade and Bow’s price tag is $50. On paper it feels like a deal and that’s not even factoring in the other aforementioned traits. Keep in mind though that Hillrock’s higher price tag also delivers a bourbon with a more developed flavor profile too.

However there’s the story of Blade and Bow, and then there’s the reality. It’s a great everyday sipping bourbon, and also forms a great base for a cocktail, you can also find a lot of bourbons out there that do the same for less. In the end I can’t help but feel you’re paying for the process and the name, versus the actual bourbon in the bottle. If you’re looking for an everyday sipping bourbon, there are a lot of great bourbons out there that will fill this need too.","Focusing on the Stitzel-Weller name more so than the bourbon itself, Blade and Bow is a good reminder that you can’t judge a book by its cover alone.","I’ll be the first to say that Blade and Bow isn’t a bad bourbon. I find it to be a perfectly acceptable everyday sipper that also works great in a number of cocktails due to its fruit-forward flavor profile. Granted while it may be priced higher than it should be, it offers the consumer an introductory experience to solera aged bourbon at a more affordable price than many of its peers.

What rubs me the wrong way though is how heavily Diageo leans on the Stitzel-Weller name to promote this brand. Sure it contains some amount of actual Stitzel-Weller distillate, but it’s in no way comparable to any of the actual Stitzel-Weller bottles I’ve tasted. It’s a shame that this wasn’t released as a new brand from a newly named distillery by Diageo. Had that been the case it would have been a great backstory with an average yet tasty bourbon. Instead, Blade and Bow is left chasing the ghosts of Stitzel-Weller and asked to perform an impossible task of trying to live up to the name of a former industry great.",Jordan,2,3,2.5,3,2,2.5,https://www.breakingbourbon.com/review/blade-bow-bourbon
,Buffalo Trace Organic Six Grain Whiskey,Classification: Whiskey,Company: Sazerac Company Inc.,Distillery: Buffalo Trace,Released: May 2017,Proof: 90,"Age: 7 Years, 1 Month","Mashbill: Undisclosed amounts of corn, buckwheat, brown rice, sorghum, wheat, and rice",Color:  Golden Straw,MSRP: $46 (375ml) (2017),Official Website,"Organic Six Grain Whiskey is being released under Buffalo Trace’s Experimental Collection. The company has 14,000 experimental barrels aging in their warehouses. Each of the barrels has unique characteristics and experimental changes in the mashbill, types of wood, barrel toasts, etc, and are released as part of the Experimental Collection.

Organic Six Grain Whiskey was distilled in early May 2010, and its mashbill contains a blend of corn, buckwheat, brown rice, sorghum, wheat, and rice. According to Buffalo Trace, this is a certified organic whiskey. All six grains received organic certification, including their production method of distillation, processing, and bottling. This whiskey consists of six grains and meets all of the requirements to be called bourbon. It’s made with at least 51% corn, with the other five grains comprising the rest of the mashbill.  However Buffalo Trace chose to refer to it as whiskey in name because it has a flavor profile that is different than the typical bourbons produced at the distillery.

Based on the data provided by Buffalo Trace, we estimate a total of 4,328 375 ml bottles comprise this limited release.","A somewhat peculiar mix of aromas that are light and airy, but still have a commanding sense about them. Herbal tones, butterscotch, and oak mingle with gentle notes of grain and rice. This mix produces a rather enjoyable aroma that is quite unique coming from a whiskey.","An earthy mix that weighs heavily on grain notes. There are moments when butterscotch and vanilla pop, but they quickly fade. Pine, wheat, maltiness, herbal tea, and apricot are also present, but the majority of these flavors are hard to discern as they are mostly muddled together.","The whiskey ends on a bit of an odd note. There’s a predominant aftertaste that is reminiscent of wood tannins, but it doesn't come off like it usually does. It most likely has to do with the number of grains involved here. There is also a small fiery blast in the finish that quickly dissipates. It’s more interesting than bad, more captivating than good.","This is the second release from Buffalo Trace in two months sporting an above-average number of grains in the mashbill. In my E.H. Taylor Four Grain review, I spoke of a lack of a benchmark when reviewing a product like this. With two such releases so close together, some interesting comparisons can be made between them. Where E.H. Taylor Four Grain was sweeter and its intensity more pitch-perfect, Organic Six Grain is a little more wild in nature. Its six grain mashbill makes for a more challenging understanding of its flavor complexity. It's actually a bit hard to pull out many specific flavors due to the whirlwind of those that are present. The whiskey is by no means offensive, just excessively unique. Scotch drinkers may be used to a wildly different tasting whiskey like this, but in the bourbon world, Organic Six Grain will probably come off as bizarre.","Buffalo Trace’s Experimental Collection has never been highly sought after by the masses. With small release numbers, 375ml bottles, limited marketing, and characteristics that appear to some as gimmicks, they aren’t on consumers' radar like some of the the company’s other releases. There must be something about experiential releases that makes consumers pause, since other companies that release similar products in the form of “master collections” or “experimental cask finishes” receive similar lukewarm responses.

That has slowly been changing. Buffalo Trace has also been doing a better job promoting their Warehouse X aging warehouse and their Experimental Collection releases. With many recent bourbon releases lacking a spark of uniqueness, it seems more eyes are beginning to turn to these “experimental” releases. The problem with “experimental” is that it can also mean taking a big, fat chance. There's little in the way of a guarantee with any release, even less so with a release like this.

Organic Six Grain isn’t too far off from E.H. Taylor Four Grain, yet it was released as part of the Experimental Collection and not as part of one of Buffalo Trace’s major brands. E.H. Four Grain was unique tasting, but still within the bourbon flavor wheelhouse to warrant a release as part of the Taylor brand at a respectable $70 asking price. Organic Six Grain at $46 for a 375ml bottle is asking a lot on paper, but there is something about half bottles that makes it a little easier to swallow. If this was sold in 750ml bottles at $92, it would be easy to overlook this release. Unique whiskeys benefit greatly when packaged in half size bottles. This might be something you’ll want to visit from time to time and is actually packaged and priced accordingly.","If odd, wild, or bizarre is how you like your whiskey, you’ve come to the right place.","There is a lot packed into one mashbill here, and being unfamiliar with many of the grains involved doesn't help matters. This is easily one of the more unique whiskey on the market from a major Kentucky distillery. Where I thought E.H. Taylor Four Grain was an admirable first edition that still had room to improve, but was worth its asking price, Organic Six Grain leans more on pure uniqueness than easy-to-love qualities. The price may sting some, but there’s little else in the bourbon market that tastes like it and for some, that might be good enough. Love or hate these types of release, the fact they bring something special to the table should always be celebrated.

,Bulleit 10 Year Bourbon,Classification: Straight Bourbon,Company: Diageo,Distillery: Undisclosed Source,Released: Ongoing,Proof: 91.2,Age: 10 Year,"Mashbill: 68% Corn, 28% Rye, 4% Malted Barley",Color:  Reddish Amber,MSRP: $45 (2017),Official Website,"According to Tom Bulleit, great-great-grandson of Augustus Bulleit, the first batch of Bulleit bourbon was made around 1830 and its production was discontinued after Augustus’s death in 1860. It’s original mash bill was two-thirds rye and one-third corn. In 1987, Tom Bulleit oversaw the distillation of the first batch of the modern-day Bulleit bourbon and paid tribute to the original mash bill by keeping the rye content higher than most bourbons on the market. In 1997, the Bulleit brand name was bought by Seagram and was introduced to U.S. markets in 1999. The Bulleit brand was acquired by Diageo when the company bought Seagram Company in 2000. Although Bulleit’s label says, “Distilled by the Bulleit Distilling Co.,” the company currently sources its bourbon. Until very recently, Four Roses was the supplier, and it is not officially known who Bulleit’s current supplier is. The brand also has no age statement and cask strength versions of their bourbon and also a rye whiskey. Bulleit is scheduled to open their own distillery at the end of 2016.

Bulleit 10 Year was a brand expansion in 2013. It has the same mashbill as their no age statement bourbon. According to Tom Bulleit in the spring 2013 Bourbon Review, “There are some barrels you come across that are good candidates to push out or age longer, and we’ve been following this system since day one. We finally got to the point where we believe we have enough quality barrels to bring an older Bourbon to the market.” He added that 10 year old bourbon is the youngest whiskey that goes into Bulleit 10 Year, with some 11 and 12 year old blended in as well.","Sweet caramel and vanilla notes are beautifully offset by toasted oak and spice. A noticeable deeper layer of citrus, cherry, butterscotch, and pepper adds a small, but beneficial layer of depth. A healthy inhale of the aromas is even more satisfying as it brings out an extra layer of intensity. While it would be going too far to call the scents amazing, they definitely leave a positive impression and are better than some bourbons twice its price.","Spice and wood jump strongly out of the gate, overlapping notes of cherry, vanilla, and leather. There is an enjoyable, yet relatively shallow amount of depth in the palate that’s over with far too quickly. A gentle sipper with a spicy bite.","There is a fleeting intensity of flavors here. There’s an immediate rush of dark fruit and rye spice that quickly peters out leaving a dry, flat, and overall one-dimensional aftertaste. Wood takes over and dominates the long finish, overstaying its welcome and lasting longer than it should.","As with the no age statement (NAS) orange label Bulleit, Bulleit 10 Year has a very spicy and wood-forward palate, but packs a little more of a pop. Surprisingly, the extra age in the barrel does little to mellow the 10 Year’s spice and it’s very hard to detect if it got any sweeter. The extra aging does bring some much needed depth to its palate that the NAS version lacks. This is important, since Bulleit 10 Year is priced in the $40 range and will be more likely consumed as a sipping bourbon vs used as more as a mixer like the NAS version. Beyond its spicy character and great nose, there is little here to call overly unique to distinguish itself from the NAS bottle.","Comparing Bulleit 10 Year to other $40-$50 bourbons, its wood and spice traits can be overbearing and won’t be for everyone. Even knowing this is sourced from Four Roses, it’s still difficult to recommend this over the slightly less expensive Four Roses Single Barrel; which is a superior product in every way. The 10 Year’s immediate burst of flavor on its palate is quite enjoyable, but it can very easily act as a diversion from the bottle’s weaknesses. It simply doesn’t have the depth and flavor range as many of the bourbons on our Best $40-$50 Bourbons list. Again, comparing it to the Bulleit NAS bourbon, it certainly has more depth, but only marginally so. It even lacks that version’s creamy mouthfeel, which as a sipping bourbon, would have greatly benefited from. While not quite overpriced in the $40 range, finding it closer to $40 is key.","Bulleit 10 Year continues with the spicy kick the the brand is known for, but its additional depth and slight refinement still doesn’t quite hit the mark other bourbons in this price range do.","The extra age seems to have done little to drastically improve the 10 Year over the NAS version. There is some refinement and additional layers of depth that makes it a better sipper, but that’s to be expected. At an additional $10-$15 over the NAS bottle, it’s debatable if it’s worth the extra money. With Bulleit’s contract with Four Roses said to have expired, it’s unclear how much 10 Year stock they still have. It will be interesting to see if the taste of the 10 Year changes over the next few years as Bulleit switches to new sourcing contracts. With Bulleit’s new distillery coming online later in 2016, it will still be a very long time before we can taste Bulleit’s own distillate aged this long. Until then, while there are no crippling flaws with Bulleit 10 Year, it just doesn’t climb to the height many $40-$50 bourbons reach.",Eric,3,2.5,2,2.5,2.5,2.5,https://www.breakingbourbon.com/review/bulleit-10-year-bourbon
,Bulleit Bourbon,Classification: Straight Bourbon,Company: Diageo,Distillery: Undisclosed Source,Released: Ongoing,Proof: 90,Age: NAS,"Mashbill: 68% Corn, 28% Rye, 4% Malted Barley",Color:  Medium Amber,MSRP: $30 (2017),Official Website,"According to Tom Bulleit, great-great-grandson of Augustus Bulleit, the first batch of Bulleit bourbon was made around 1830 and its production was discontinued after Augustus’s death in 1860.

The brand also has 10 year and cask strength versions of their bourbon and also a rye whiskey.","Equal amounts of vanilla, caramel, and orange zest overlay more tamer notes of smoke, cherry, and oak. There’s a good amount of richness to the aromas, however they’re light on depth. An enjoyable spiciness bounces off the sweeter notes, but overall the nose is quite frank; straightforward with little fuss.","A sweet caramel opening quickly transforms into a peppery oak bomb. Despite its light body it still manages to have a creamy mouthfeel and the palate surprisingly packs a burst of flavor. Unfortunately, this flavor pop is one-dimensional and not very complex, simply consisting of pepper and oak. Minor notes of cinnamon and ginger are also present, but they struggle to shine over the bourbon's spiciness.","The bourbon’s hardfisted spiciness continues until the very end. Spice, pepper, and oak dominate, with notes of butterscotch, mint, and cherry wavering in and out. There is an enjoyable amount of smoothness and creaminess on the finish that keeps the peppery spice from being too hard to drink. This is again surface-level complexity on display, but just enough overall quality to make the bourbon enjoyable.","Quickly over the past 10 years, Bulleit has made a big name for itself. The brand has given Maker’s Mark and Jim Beam a run for their money, appearing on, what feels, just as many bar shelves in the U.S. as those major brands. Being owned by Diageo doesn’t quite make Bulleit’s rise a David versus Goliath story, but doing it so quickly and effectively is quite a feat. This is in large part due to Diageo’s marketing muscle, which also extends to Bulleit’s now-iconic and much-loved bottle design. Of course another large part has to do with what’s inside the bottle.

It is now known that Four Roses had been supplying Diageo with a special blend for their brand for years. Despite consumers not officially knowing for years that the bourbon was sourced from Four Roses, it was still their quality stock, which probably had a lot to do why it resonated with people and aided with Bulleit’s quick rise in popularity. With that arrangement now said to be ending (or ended), and Diageo sourcing from a new producer while Bulleit gets their own distillery up and running (due to open in late 2016), it’s getting harder to know just what Bulleit actually is.

As with the case with any non-distiller-producer (NDP), maintaining a consistent flavor profile must be an endless challenge and one Bulleit probably hasn’t had to contend with in a long time. As a result of sourcing, Bulleit has an overall respectable level of quality stemming from the deal they made with Four Roses years ago, but the bourbon’s lack of complexity and memorable characteristics beyond its spiciness may have a lot to do with lack of direct control of their own product.","Bulleit is foremost marketed as a mixing bourbon. As such, its high-rye content results in ample amounts of pepper and spice, which helps the bourbon stand up no matter what it’s mixed with. This boldness and overall quality helps put Bulleit in the higher echelon of mixing bourbons. Its $30+ price further re-enforces this, as it’s higher than Maker’s Mark and Jim Beam, making its perception of value appears greater. Much like the sweeping price fluctuations consumers see with major sellers like Maker’s Mark and Jim Beam, Bulleit is also privy to the same price variations and often found below $30 in some markets.

From a sipping bourbon standpoint, Bulleit also holds up well. It’s easy to drink, and its spicy pop makes it standout from most bourbons. It’s not infinitely better than other $30 bourbons, in fact it’s very comparable to many in that range. It’s more up to a person’s personal flavor preference since nothing about this bourbon screams amazing. It wants to be the best at both worlds, and while it doesn’t quite achieve it, it’s a respectable showing.","A versatile bourbon that works well mixing and sipping, but its spiciness and lack of complexity won’t make it a hit with everyone.","Most likely due in large part to Diageo’s marketing, I’m more apt to use Bulleit in my next cocktail than similar priced bourbons such as Four Roses Small Batch, Buffalo Trace, or Henry McKenna (all of which are superior sipping bourbons). It does tend to make a better cocktail mixer than Maker’s Mark or Jim Beam because of its extra spiciness, but it comes with a higher cost. At the same time, that higher cost brings with it additional quality and the option to enjoy drinking it neat. Versatility is probably Bulleit’s most redeeming trait.

It will be interesting to see how Bulleit’s flavor profile might change over the next few years as NDPs have been experiencing much more competition sourcing bourbon for their brands than they use to. If Bulleit can maintain a steady flow of quality bourbon and maintain a similar flavor profile, they should be able to weather the storm. Bulleit isn’t quite in the sweet position they have been in years past, but relying on their reputation should buy them some time until their own distillery is up and running. At that point it’s even possible we’ll see an improved product, as they will be able to control their own product from start to finish.",Eric,2.5,2.5,2.5,2.5,2.5,2.5,https://www.breakingbourbon.com/review/bulleit-bourbon
,Bulleit Bourbon Barrel Strength,Classification: Straight Bourbon,Company: Diageo,Distillery: Sourced,Released: April 2016 in Kentucky,Proof: 119,Age: NAS (Blend of 5-8 year old bourbon),"Mashbill: 68% Corn, 28% Rye, 4% Malted Barley",Color: Medium Amber,"MSRP: $30 (375ml), $50 (750ml) (2016)",Official Website,"Bulleit Bourbon Barrel Strength is currently only available at the Stitzel-Weller Distillery gift shop, Kentucky liquor stores, and “whiskey-forward restaurants and bars.” Diageo is limiting the release to 3,000 cases and offering the bourbon in 375 and 750ml bottles. The proof ranges from 118-125. The company has not announced if they plan to expand distribution outside Kentucky. Update: Bulleit Bourbon Barrel Strength is now available in wide release.","Vanilla and caramel notes interweave with stronger blasts of pepper and cinnamon. It’s a pleasant mixture of sweet and spice that has some strength to it, yet doesn't come off as too strong. Minor notes of butterscotch and custard pop up, but do little to add much complexity. It smells richer and thicker as compared to Bulleit 10 Year, but not necessarily any better.","Lots of cinnamon and spice. It's a straightforward palate that merely intensifies what you may love or hate about the standard Bulleit Bourbon. It’s once again very peppery and oaky, but surprisingly not as overbearing as what I thought an additional 29 proof points might do to the standard version. Working the bourbon around in your mouth pulls out some minor fruit notes that would have otherwise remained unknown. It’s not an earth shattering discovery, but an enjoyable bright spot in an otherwise ho-hum experience.","Straightforward and consistent: starts hot, develops some creaminess, and finishes dry. The finish lacks much flavor besides plentiful notes of oak and spice, which is to be expected coming from a barrel strength version of the standard Bulleit Bourbon. The extra proof points have done little to pull out additional flavors from the standard version and instead simply make it hotter and amplify the spicier notes. It’s marginally enjoyable but still not all that interesting.","Any time a popular brand decides to release a barrel strength version of their standard product, people take extra notice. The common assumption that barrel proof means better, simply because a higher alcohol concentration should bring enhanced flavors, isn’t always as guaranteed as people may think. Companies get a lot of flak when they “water down” their product for a sub-100 proof release, but this might be a time where that water helps tame an otherwise overpowering flavor agent that is hard to taste past. The problem is the standard Bulleit Bourbon isn’t all that unique or complex to begin with. It’s a long shot to expect adding proof points is going to drastically enhance the standard Bulleit, which as the Barrel Strength demonstrates, does not.","The standard Bulleit Bourbon is priced in the $30 range and the 10 Year in the $40 range, so it makes sense for the Barrel Strength version to be priced in the $50 range. With the majority of barrel strength bourbons also priced in this range, it’s logical for Bulleit to follow suit. Except in this case, Bulleit Barrel Strength doesn’t compare flavorwise to other barrel strength bourbons and has a harder time offering the same value.

For many Bulleit superfans, having access to a higher proof Bulleit is priceless and comparisons to other brands are meaningless. But for someone looking for a rich and satisfying barrel strength bourbon, there are better options in the same price range. Comparing this to the similarly priced and easily obtainable Booker’s, it’s a no-contest. Booker’s beats it in every category. The same holds true for other slightly more expensive and harder to find barrel strength bourbons, such as Elijah Craig Barrel Proof and Four Roses private selections. Bulleit Bourbon Barrel Strength is a good example that not all barrel strength bourbons are created equal.",Higher proof does little to drastically change the standard Bulleit Bourbon flavor profile.,"Adding proof points doesn’t always mean a better product and that’s clearly on display with Bulleit Barrel Strength. The standard Bulleit Bourbon is a popular mixing bourbon because its heavy oak and spicy notes stand up well in cocktails. The same can be said about Bulleit Bourbon Barrel Strength, as the oak and spice will have no problem standing out in a cocktail thanks to its higher proof. The underlying problem with Bulleit in all of its bourbon forms, is that it’s just not that interesting. There are far better options to sip neat or even to mix with. The main thing Bulleit has going for it is its availability. Most stores stock it and it’s often the best option available at bars. Sure that’s not much of an endorsement, but sometimes simply showing up can be enough. For Bulleit Bourbon Barrel Strength, I was hoping for something more, but what I got was a hotter version of the standard Bulleit Bourbon - nothing more, nothing less.",Eric,3,2.5,2,2.5,2.5,2.5,https://www.breakingbourbon.com/review/bulleit-bourbon-barrel-strength
,David Nicholson Reserve Bourbon,Classification: Straight Bourbon,Company: Luxco,Distillery: Undisclosed,Release Date: Ongoing,Proof: 100,Age: NAS,Mashbill: Undisclosed (stated to be a high-rye bourbon),Color: Copper,MSRP: $35 (2019),Official Website,"David Nicholson, a St Louis, Missouri grocery store owner during the 1840’s, created what became known as the “43” bourbon recipe. This wheated mashbill was passed down unaltered for generations according to the Luxco’s website. Over the years, Luxco has quietly (and not so quietly) been refreshing many of their brands. David Nicholson 1843 was a regional product often showing up on store shelves around St Louis until Luxco started expanding the reach of the brand. The company also added David Nicholson Reserve, a high-rye sourced bourbon to complement their sourced wheated bourbon.","Aromas of caramel, toffee, gingerbread, and pecan are straightforward and to the point. This makes for a pleasant and easy to parse nose. There isn’t a lot of depth, but its aromas blend well and have a welcomed potency.","Noticeably thin at first sip, its oak and nutty notes are hard to ignore and do a lot to make up for its thinness. These flavors provide such a strong backbone to the palate that the bourbon’s other flavors struggle to create their own attention. These sweeter notes of caramel, vanilla, and butterscotch are helpful in working towards a more balanced flavor profile, but just don’t quite pull it off. Despite this lopsidedness, it's still quite enjoyable to sip.","Its medium to long finish is oak-forward, creating a rather dry and at times, bitter aftertaste. Rye spice further adds to its rusticness, creating a finish that is deep in barrel influence. It won’t be for everyone, but it surprisingly complements its palate nicely.","The David Nicholson bourbons are yet another brand with a story seemingly steeped in tradition that makes you wonder if it has any relevance to the modern day bourbon drinker. This one in particular comes off a bit thin on the surface as it’s simply a story of a recipe being passed down from generation to generation. Taking it at face value though, similar parallels can be made today. It's a story of a store owner trying to offer his patrons something unique that they could only get at his store. Private selections, oddball blends, and one-off sourcing are more popular than ever with everyone from liquor stores, modern day grocers, to online bourbon enthusiasts groups, websites, and podcasts all following, in a way, what David Nicholson did almost 200 years ago.

Except this brand’s story centers around David Nicholson 1843, and not David Nicholson Reserve, which is a high-rye bourbon Luxco sources from an undisclosed distillery in Kentucky (thought to be Heaven Hill). It’s a very matter-of-fact bourbon, both in its flavor profile and depth. I don’t knock its overall quality and rather enjoyed its nut centric palate, but there isn’t much it does that will necessarily surprise you.","With Luxco offering this bourbon in more markets, this might be the first time you heard about the brand. Generally found between $35-$40, it settles in an appropriate range a bourbon of its quality and uniqueness might be expected to. Despite wider distribution, it still isn’t overly common to find. If your curiosity gets the best of you, that could be worth the few extra bucks. Although paying on the higher end of its price range may make you wish the bourbon had a bit more going on. The result is a price that will have a drastic impact on expectations you place on this bourbon. Think of it this way, Wild Turkey 101 Bourbon and Buffalo Trace Bourbon are enjoyable sippers, but paying $40 for them is a hard sell. The same goes for David Nicholson Reserve.",David Nicholson Reserve is an oak and nut forward bourbon that is an enjoyable sipper as long as the price and expectations are kept in check.,"Sipping on David Nicholson Reserve took me back to my days with Kentucky Vintage and Old Grand-Dad 114. Similar in vein, these bourbons won’t necessarily knock your socks off, but provide a satisfying and expectation humbling drinking experience. David Nicholson Reserve’s oak and nut filled palate worked for me, and while its finish is dry and bitter at times, there are moments of butterscotch and caramel sweetness that help counter it. Kentucky Vintage might not be winning any awards from enthusiasts, but sometimes the bourbon simply hits the spot. That is exactly how I ended up feeling about David Nicholson Reserve.

,E.H. Taylor Seasoned Wood,Classification: Straight Bourbon,Company: Sazerac Company Inc.,Distillery: Buffalo Trace,Released: March 2016,Proof: 100,Age: NAS (Press release states “Well over a decade”),Mashbill: Undisclosed,Color:  Copper,MSRP: $70 (2016),Official Website,"According to Buffalo Trace, the barrels in this release underwent a variety of special seasoning processes, including utilizing staves that were immersed in an enzyme rich bath with water heated to 100 degrees to make the barrels. After spending time in this proprietary solution, these staves were then placed into kilns and dried until they reached an ideal humidity level for crafting into barrels. Other staves were seasoned outdoors for six months, and still others were left outdoors for a full 12 months before being made into barrels and sent to the Buffalo Trace Distillery to be filled and aged. All barrel staves were seasoned, dried, and crafted at Independent Stave Company, who consulted on this project with the premiere expert on oak maturation, Dr. James Swan. Like E.H. Taylor Cured Oak, E.H. Taylor Seasoned Wood is a planned one-time release.

Seasoned Wood is a wheated bourbon. This is the first wheated bourbon Buffalo Trace has released under the E.H. Taylor brand. Buffalo Trace currently makes only one wheated mashbill, but utilizes different warehouses and warehouse floors to create different variations in the flavor profiles.

This is a Bottled in Bond (BiB) bourbon. To be labelled BiB, the whiskey must be the product of one distillation season and one distiller at a single distillery, aged in a federally bonded warehouse under U.S. government supervision for at least four years, and it must be bottled at exactly 100 proof. Additionally, the BiB label must clearly identify the distillery where it was distilled and where it was bottled, if different.","An immediate greeting of fruit that’s rather light, which is also an ample way of describing the overall intensity of the nose. Notes of dried berries, oak, and peach are present, but have a shyness to them. Vanilla and caramel are the dominant scents and even they aren’t very intense. There is a bit of depth to the nose but it does little to show itself off. You’ll have to actively focus on deconstructing the nose in order to discover them all, as they don’t come willingly. What it maybe lacking in intensity makes up for more than a little of it with it’s overall quality of the scents.","A fair amount of oak, butterscotch, and allspice that leans heavily on the nutty side. Oak is ever present throughout, but not to the point of overburdening the palate. The bourbon’s medium weight consistency carries tannins throughout that errs more on the astringent side and less on the bitter side. It’s surface-level complexity does little to keep my interest, as I find little to delight in here. An average palate from a brand known for much more.","A fair amount of oak, butterscotch, and allspice that leans heavily on the nutty side.

An average palate from a brand known for much more.","With barrels responsible for giving bourbon a considerable amount of their flavor characteristics, making changes to this source can have drastic effects. By adjusting the seasoning process for this release (see sidebar), there must have been high hopes at Buffalo Trace that something incredibly unique would come of it.

In a way, the reverse seems to have happened. Instead of more intense or layered flavors, the palate tastes like it retracted into itself. The result is a more muted and quite frankly, sheepish palate. The bourbon comes across as having a surface-level complexity with a budget-bourbon tasting experience. Spending time with it reveals some complexities, but far too few to make this anything but an empty experience. I give Buffalo Trace credit for experimenting with a unique process, however the end result is a boring bourbon.","There is always some inherent value when a major company tries something different. It’s a captivating window into their thought process. It’s similar to when auto companies build concept cars. You’ll probably never see them in everyday life, but this thinking outside of the box is fascinating for everyone.

The modern day E.H. Taylor brand has a short list of special releases. Because of this, they often get increased attention. If Seasoned Wood was released as part of Buffalo Trace’s Experimental Collection, expectations and the inevitable buying frenzy would be greatly tempered. Instead, we’ll get a repeat situation of last year’s E.H. Taylor Cured Oak. Impossible to find except for on the secondary market at five times its MSRP.

With any special release - or more experiment in this case - deciding if it’s a good value isn’t always obvious. Often times special releases automatically mean higher MSRPs despite what is in the bottle. Buffalo Trace has maintained restraint with the pricing of many of their products including this one. $70 for last year’s Cured Oak was arguably a fair price. Unfortunately with Seasoned Wood and its lackluster delivery, this same asking price isn’t as good this time around. Fascinating experiment or not, what’s in the bottle just isn’t worth its asking price.","Aged for well over a decade in barrels that underwent a series of unique treatments, high expectations for Seasoned Wood fall flat as the end result is nothing more than a boring bourbon.","Not all special releases can be home runs. Last’s year’s Cured Oak was heavy on the oak for many people, but there were also a lot of other great things going on underneath it. Overall this is an average bourbon that doesn’t contain any real elements to cheer about. I do however applaud the fortitude Buffalo Trace’s Master Distiller Harlen Wheatley took with this. Buffalo Trace has been experimenting with a number of new techniques and their new Warehouse X is to be celebrated. Unfortunately, Seasoned Wood just isn’t the memorable bourbon that I was hoping it would be. Not every release needs to be fireworks in your mouth, but I don’t want a palate that’s afraid of its own shadow either. Buffalo Trace releases so many great products that it makes it all the more disappointing that Seasoned Wood fell flat and couldn’t deliver a better bourbon for its price.

,Elijah Craig 23 Year,Classification: Straight Bourbon,Company: Heaven Hill,Distillery: Heaven Hill,Released: August 2014 / Ongoing,Proof: 90,Age: 23 Years,"Mashbill: 78% Corn, 12% Malted Barley, and 10% Rye",Color:  Deep Copper,MSRP: $200 (2014),Official Website,"Barreled on March 30, 1990. Barrel No. 137","This nose is best described as woody, which shouldn’t come as much of a surprise since it’s been sitting in the barrel for 23 years. Deep notes of mahogany are up front and present upon first smelling this bourbon. Hiding behind the mahogany are light traces of grain and dried fruit, predominantly dried cherry. While very pleasant, the nose is much more subtle than prior editions of high aged Elijah Craig. It just didn't hold my attention as much as some of the others.

Elijah Craig 21 Year opened up a lot with 5-6 drops of water when I reviewed it, so I decided to do the same when tasting this 23 year old. This time around, the water added very little to the overall nose. Instead it tended to enhance the mahogany smell to a fuller, deeper version. Unfortunately this came as a tradeoff since it slightly muted the light traces of grain and dried fruit that were present before adding the water.","Wood, wood, and more wood…this bourbon is an oak monster! Up front you’re hit with a taste of very dried charred oak, which is the predominant flavor profile for this bourbon. It’s hard to describe just how dry this bourbon is. The best comparison I have is if you were to take a sip of a very dry red wine and have almost all of the moisture sucked right out of your mouth. Additional hints of vanilla, honey and leather linger behind the wood taste.

Adding water to the palate greatly enhanced it. While still dry, the palate lost a lot of its wood flavor profile, and instead bursted to life with sweet flavors of honey, dried cherries, apricot, and sunflower seeds (oddly enough!). The palate became very enjoyable after adding the water and even though it didn’t enhance the nose, I wouldn’t recommend drinking this bourbon any other way.","The dryness of the palate continues through to the finish. A mellow long finish of roasted nuts, leather, aged tobacco and light traces of pepper linger in your mouth.

Adding a few drops of water brought out more woody notes to the finish. Wood, dried raisins, and aged leather dominate after adding the water. Even with the water, the finish was long and mellow, and lingered in my mouth for an appreciable amount of time.","Elijah Craig 23 Year continues Heaven Hill’s series of aging their Elijah Craig bourbon a year longer. Starting in 2012 with Elijah Craig 20 Year and continuing every year thereafter, Heaven Hill has continued to age their signature Elijah Craig 18 Year bourbon one more year - giving you a unique chance to sample each year, compare years, and really see how the bourbon tastes with the additional aging. This, in my opinion, has been a really fun series to try out, since it gives you the opportunity to see what the ideal aging time is for Elijah Craig versus a single year release like so many other ultra-aged bourbons (Old Blowhard, Parkers Heritage 27 Year, etc.)

And, each of the bottles are single barrels, which provides even more of a unique opportunity since very few ultra-aged bourbons are single barreled. This may not always be a great thing however, since you’re paying a high value for a bottle that may or may not be that great depending on the barrel.","At $200 a bottle, Elijah Craig 23 is well into the super-premium bourbon category. You’re not paying for a phenomenal taste with this edition. Instead, you’re paying for the privilege to try Elijah Craig aged 23 years. Unlike the EC 21 or EC 22 that command the price premium, this bourbon just falls short of expectations for the price. I would be hard pressed to recommend this bottle at $150 (the cost of prior editions), let alone $200. Even Old Blowhard, which was a 26 year old comparable oak monster, sold for $150.","Father Time finally caught up with the ultra aged Elijah Craig series, as this 23 year old version spent one too many years in the barrel.","Few bourbons can age this long and still offer a great well-rounded experience. Like past editions, the nose is quite enjoyable and the highlight of this bourbon. However this time around, the palate and finish just didn’t offer the same great experience. They’re not bad per say, but they’re also not great given what you would expect from a bourbon in this price range.

I do, however, see Elijah Craig 23 Year having it’s time and place. I could see it being used in limited occasions. Like, the entire time I was drinking it, I couldn't stop thinking about sipping it in front of a fire with a fine cigar to complement it. That being said, given the price, I'd recommend trying it at the bar vs. sinking money into a full bottle. Hopefully Heaven Hill realizes the limit of aging time on their bourbon and scales back production to bourbon aged 22 yrs or less.",Jordan,3,2.5,2.5,4,1.5,2.5,https://www.breakingbourbon.com/review/elijah-craig-23-year
,Elijah Craig Rye,Classification: Straight Rye,Company: Heaven Hill,Distillery: Heaven Hill,Release Date: January 2020/Ongoing,Proof: 94,Age: NAS,"Mashbill: 51% Rye, 35% Corn, 14% Malted Barley",Color: Light Copper,Price: $30 (2020),Official Website,"Elijah Craig Small Batch Bourbon is a widely distributed bourbon that is typically readily available and generally well-known. In October 2019, Heaven Hill announced the launch of Elijah Craig Straight Rye, which would be packaged and priced similar to its bourbon counterpart distinguished by new bottle decoration, face, side, and neck labels with green features. According to the company’s press release, “Elijah Craig Rye is made as a traditional American Straight Rye Whiskey with 51% rye, 35% corn and 14% malted barley. This combination of grains, which relies heavily on corn as the secondary grain rather than a higher percentage of rye, has been the primary Rye mashbill used by Kentucky Bourbon distilleries since taking over virtually all American Rye production post-Prohibition; the same mashbill directly responsible for the Rye resurgence seen today."" This will be an ongoing nationwide release.",Black pepper and summer fruits form against an herbal bouquet. Mild in its intensity the aromas find the middle ground between blasé and inviting.,"Surprisingly sweet; kettle corn and caramel sweetness originate first. A mix of allspice, nutmeg, and rye grain follows. The sweetness remains though, and begins to ramp up into the finish. Light bodied and mild in its intensity overall.","A crescendo of sweetness introduces vanilla and butterscotch, which is quickly met with a hit of lasting rye spice. The finish delivers the right level of intensity which is lacking in the nose and palate, making it the highlight of the sip.","Elijah Craig Rye originates from Heaven Hill’s 51% rye mashbill, which also includes Pikesville Rye and Rittenhouse Rye brands. This mashbill is often referred to as a “barely legal rye” mashbill as it contains the bare minimum 51% rye required by law. Barely legal ryes are produced by numerous distilleries, and often contain a high percentage of corn as the secondary grain. In this case, the combination of 51% rye and 35% corn is arguably not far off from a bourbon that could legally contain 51% corn and 35% rye, or some higher proportion of rye if malted barley was reduced.

As a result of its relatively low rye, high corn content, the flavor profile of Elijah Craig Rye is quite similar to what might be expected from a bourbon (though, notably, it lacks the oak forwardness of its bourbon counterpart, Elijah Craig Small Batch Bourbon). If poured blind, I think few would be able to confidently identify it as a rye versus a bourbon. But this is merely an observation, and surely the end result Heaven Hill is going for. Utilizing their existing rye mashbill, they were able to simply change up the target flavor profile from some of their existing brands. And while Elijah Craig Rye will certainly be a crowd pleaser, it offers only a slight variation from other ryes in the marketplace.","Value is where Elijah Craig Rye shines. Heaven Hill has built a reputation on producing great whiskeys for a fair, or even better-than-fair price. While it would be easy to argue that Rittenhouse Rye Bottled in Bond is a very similar product given it comes from the same mashbill and is released at only 6 proof points higher, it does have a different, and more punchy fruit-forward flavor profile. And while Rittenhouse is widely distributed, I expect Elijah Craig Rye to ultimately become more prevalent on liquor store shelves. Presumably Heaven Hill plans to produce a lot of Elijah Craig Rye, and in so doing establish it as a product that's more “front and center” similar to Elijah Craig Small Batch Bourbon.

There are plenty of other comparisons that could be made including the still relatively new to market Old Forester Rye, but the one that seems to stand out the most to me is Knob Creek Rye. Given its nationwide availability and overall likability, it comes in at only $10 higher. While it does offer 6 additional proof points, I would guess that the same person regularly reaching for Knob Creek Rye would also be interested in Elijah Craig Rye. And while Knob Creek's flavor profile does exhibit a bit more character, Elijah Craig has what I would call a more mainstream flavor profile that offers greater mass appeal. At $30 compared to Knob Creek's $40, Elijah Craig Rye is also better priced to draw the masses, and I believe over time it will.","Elijah Craig Rye's combination of a flavor profile with mass appeal, great price, and recognizable branding makes it a contender for becoming one of the most popular ryes on the market.","Many people are already familiar with the Elijah Craig brand, so it makes perfect sense that Heaven Hill would introduce a rye to sit beside its popular Small Batch Bourbon counterpart. Put simply, Elijah Craig Rye is light and approachable, but it also lacks complexity and oak influence which I think will make it come across as somewhat boring to seasoned rye drinkers. While it may not wow anyone with its mild intensity of flavors, its approachability, recognizable branding, and ultimately its $30 price point, will serve it well.

,Elijah Craig Small Batch,Classification: Straight Bourbon,Company: Heaven Hill,Distillery: Heaven Hill,Released: Ongoing,Proof: 94,Age: NAS,"Mashbill: 78% Corn, 12% Malted Barley, and 10% Rye",Color:  Copper,MSRP: $26 (2019),Official Website,"Elijah Craig was a baptist preacher who created the process for “true Kentucky bourbon.” He’s credited with the process of putting his distillate into charred oak barrels.

Citing a surge in popularity and supply not meeting demand, in early 2016 Heaven Hill removed Elijah Craig 12 Year's age statement. At the time, brands such as Weller 12 Year and 1792 8 Year were facing the same issue. In the end Weller 12 Year kept its age statement and became hard to find and saw an increased price. 1792 lost its age statement and kept its availability and price point. Heaven Hill chose the latter path and began blending younger stock into its non-age stated (NAS) small batches. Years later, the brand is readily available and has maintained its mid-$20 price point.","Vanilla, caramel, nut, and oak pop out from the start. Sweet and light at first, these flavors slightly intensify with time in the glass. On its own, the nose is slightly above average and enjoyable, but also quite simple.","The amount of flavors are on the thin side, with healthy amounts of oak and vanilla dominating. The bourbon has a nice roundness to its mouthfeel that makes it a joy to sip, but it's more of a blunt oaky and sweet vanilla flavor hit, than a complex array of flavors. That said, it's an enjoyable sip.","Cinnamon and oak aftertaste that does a good job lingering long after the sip. Mild heat and intensity is adequate as it is satisfying, but overall the finish is average at best.","It’s hard to see any age statement go away, but at this point, its 12 Year predecessor seems like a lifetime ago and not all that relevant any more. Truthfully the NAS Small Batch probably aligns to more peoples’ tastes than the even more oak heavy 12 Year Small Batch did. In the current bourbon climate, drinkers aren’t trained to expect much from a $20-$30 bourbon anymore, and Elijah Craig NAS Small Batch exemplifies this. Far from a bad bourbon, it happily settles for “just enough” or “good enough” in its current form. It fits right in line with what its contemporaries offer for better or for worse and is a solid and agreeable pour for a decent price. It just doesn’t stand out like it once did.","It quite amazing that Heaven Hill has been able to maintain Elijah Craig’s mid-$20 price point for such a long period of time. Even its contemporaries, Buffalo Trace and Four Roses Small Batch said goodbye to their $20 price point some time ago. We wrote about the disappearing $20 range of bourbons, yet Elijah Craig has managed to skirt this trend and become (or at least maintained its position as) one of the main poster-bourbons of the price range. Even the brand’s excellent private selectionsoften cost only a few dollars more than the NAS Small Batch. No one wants to pay more and get less, and in a way that is what Heaven Hill gave us in 2016 when changing this into a NAS small batch bourbon. Yet, the change wasn’t as damaging to the bourbon and its value as drinkers feared, thanks to the strong and quality base Elijah Craig bourbon is crafted on. In its current form, it might not offer the value it once did, but it’s still a solid buy for its price.","An inoffensive, well-rounded bourbon that doesn’t try to wow, but instead simply offers a good bourbon at a good price.","It’s only those who know what came before that will probably take issue with this bourbon. In its current state and time, it’s exactly what it needs to be. Classic bourbon flavors of sweet vanilla and mellowed oak with a welcoming amount of heat are the quintessential bourbon characteristics. Offered at a remarkable mid-$20 price point, it's hard to beat pound for pound. What it lacks in strong memorable characteristics it makes up for in drinkability and value. It will satisfy, yet simultaneously make you wonder where a drinker should head to next. In Heaven Hill’s portfolio, Henry McKenna Single Barrel is that next step. Elijah Craig Small Batch is a brand that may have changed over the years, but it's still able to offer what its always been known for, drinkability and value.",Eric,3,2.5,2.5,2.5,3,2.5,https://www.breakingbourbon.com/review/elijah-craig-small-batch
,Fighting Cock Kentucky Straight Bourbon,Classification: Straight Bourbon,Company: Fighting Cock Distilling Company,Distillery: Heaven Hill,Released: Ongoing,Proof: 103,Age: NAS,"Mashbill: 75% Corn, 13% Rye, 12% Malted Barley",Color:  Copper,MSRP: $20 (2018),Official Website,"Fighting Cock is one of several Heaven Hill brands that falls in the $20 and under range. Bernie Lubbers, an American whiskey brand ambassador for Heaven Hill, stated on the Bourbon Pursuit Podcast that Fighting Cock was released as a direct competitor to Wild Turkey 101 Bourbon. According to Lubbers, Heaven Hill likes to do things ""better and cheaper"" than the competitors, which is why Fighting Cock has the name it does, and comes in at 103 proof, which is 2 proof points higher than WT 101.

Fighting Cock formerly carried a 6 year age statement, however that was removed in 2015 and now is bottled as a non age stated (NAS) variant. Based on its labelling, the law requires the youngest bourbon in the bottle to be at least four years old, however Heaven Hill has stated they continue to include older whiskey in the blend.

Fun fact, Heaven Hill also refers to this brand as the “kickin’ chicken.”","Banana forward with light vanilla, walnut, and oak in the background. It doesn’t have a complex aroma, but its simplicity doesn’t mean it’s boring either. In fact, it’s quite inviting. There is zero ethanol present, which for a sub $20 higher proof bourbon, is surprising.","Super sweet with a touch of heat. The palate has a nice mouthfeel, and is dominated by baked bananas drizzled with syrup. Additionally, you get a nice amount of heat via a mixed black and white pepper combination, which ends up complementing the sweeter notes. While the palate is also on the simpler side, it’s very enjoyable.","The finish is contrasting compared to the sweeter nose and palate that come before it. The peppery heat carries through to start the finish, and is joined with oak and leather to form a drier overall finish profile. The finish is shorter and disappointingly ends rather abruptly without any fanfare.","If this had this been a few years ago, a majority of this section would have been celebrating Heaven Hill for releasing a surprisingly drinkable six year old bourbon under $20. It also would have most likely been described a much more “fiery” bourbon with a kick, which is how a majority of people described their experience with the 6 year age stated bourbon.

Unfortunately, that’s not the case today. While its value is commendable, the fact of the matter remains that it’s a NAS bourbon with a more simplistic flavor profile. This is certainly not unique nowadays, but other sub $20 bourbons like Heaven Hill BIB and Four Roses Yellow at least bring an extra memorable element to their flavor profiles. Credit needs to be given to Fighting Cock for how drinkable it is at 103 proof, however along those same lines, I was also surprised to see the lack of flavor for a 103 proof bourbon, which is a shame.","Often times people have preconceived notions that if a bourbon is on the bottom shelf and sells for under $20, it must not be that great. Fighting Cock helps to break that perception and delivers an easy to drink bourbon that can be appreciated by anyone. While the nose and palate are simple and the finish is short and dry, overall this is an enjoyable bourbon for the price. Fighting Cock holds up well when compared to its competition in this value price range, especially for the price being offered.","This cock might not have a lot of bite, but it delivers an easy drinking experience at an everyman's price.","I’ll admit it. I avoided Fighting Cock for the longest time due to the perception I had built up in my mind about it. Here was a bourbon that I vaguely remember buying shortly after turning 21 because I thought it had a funny name. Back then, this bourbon to me was meant for shots or for mixing and it stayed etched in my mind as a bottom shelf bourbon that didn’t need to be re-explored.

All these years later, I’m glad that I gave Fighting Cock a second chance. This bourbon offers a simple and smooth drinking experience that almost all will enjoy. It may not be the spicier higher proof version of Wild Turkey 101 that Heaven Hill claims it was aiming to be, but what it is, is good. And in today’s crowded marketplace full of new bourbons looking for the next gimmick, good is enough.",Jordan,3,3,2,2,3,2.5,https://www.breakingbourbon.com/review/fighting-cock-kentucky-straight-bourbon
,Fistful of Bourbon,Classification: Blend of Straight Bourbons,Company: William Grant & Sons,Distillery: Undisclosed Distilleries,Released: Ongoing,Proof: 90,Age: 2 Years (Minimum),Mashbill: Undisclosed,Color: Amber,MSRP: $25 (2020),Official Website,"William Grant & Sons is a family-owned Scottish company that owns many notable scotch distilleries such as Glenfiddich and Balvenie. They also own many other spirits companies: Tullamore Irish Whiskey, Hendrick’s Gin, and Sailor Jerry Rum to name a few. Up until recently their brand portfolio didn’t include bourbon. In 2017, they purchased Tuthilltown Spirits, which is best known for Hudson Whiskey. In 2018, they launched Fistful of Bourbon, a blend of five straight bourbons spearheaded by William Grant & Sons’ master blender Brian Kinsman and blender Kelsey McKechnie. Kinsman’s philosophy that “blending is more of an art than a science” has aided his 23 year career with the company and was called upon to create and launch Fistful of Bourbon, a new bourbon brand for the company.","A very bright and expressive aroma that starts with pear, green apple, and mint, before following with sweet corn and lemon. It’s not overly complex by any means but satisfying nevertheless. There’s only a slight twinge of oak, which is probably due to its overall age, yet it lacks any overpowering grain or ethanol notes that's typical of young whiskey.","A nicely layered flavor profile immediately jumps out at you. It’s quite floral at first sip before transitioning to lemon, corn, toffee, vanilla, and oak. It’s a gentle evolution from lighter and citrus notes to dark and heavy notes that keeps the bourbon interesting throughout its sip.","The heavier flavors of the palate are carried over to the finish along with a touch of heat, anise, toasted nuts, and a dash of cinnamon, before settling on oak. It’s an appropriate ending given the flavor journey this bourbon takes you on. Adequate complexity and intensity helps end the bourbon in a satisfying place.","Fistful of Bourbon prides itself on its blending origins, which isn’t surprising given the bourbon’s name. Many bourbons are blended either from barrels from the same company that produced them, or non-distiller producers who source barrels from one or more distilleries and blend them together themselves.  

Fistful of Bourbon is a blended bourbon from five different straight bourbons and unfortunately, no information is given of their origins. This is common practice in the scotch world in which William Grant & Sons has a rich history with. Sourcing origins aren’t usually given in the bourbonsphere either due to contract stipulations, but there is certainly a trend moving to highlight origins and celebrate heritage whenever possible in the American whiskey market. When I first saw Fistful of Bourbon, I expected this to be a collaboration of five craft distilleries blending their bourbons to create something new, exciting, and possibly extraordinary. But this is not what Fistful of Bourbon is about. Which seems like a bit of a missed opportunity.

Looking at what this bourbon is, instead of what it isn’t, doesn’t change the fact that the blending of five different bourbons helped create a nicely layered whiskey who’s flavor profile evolves throughout its sip. Despite its young age statement, it features much more character than you’d expect it should have, and at no point does it taste like a two year old bourbon. With its sum likely being greater than its individual parts, it's a testament to the benefits of blending and the skill of master blender Brian Kinsman.","This bourbon might not have received the attention it has received if it wasn’t for its price. With the disappearance of the $20 range category of American whiskeys over the last five years, it's attention grabbing when one hits the market in that range. Brands of course need to overcome the perception that anything inexpensive is bottom shelf swill. In the age of social media and lightning fast word of mouth, those once difficult perceptions are easier to overcome and what William Grant & Sons are probably hedging their bets on. In the last year alone, quite a few brands, both large and small, have begun to target the sub-$30 price range again.  

Fistful of Bourbon’s $25 price tag is indeed attention grabbing, but what is more noteworthy is it will likely exceed people’s expectations because of its low price. A lot of it is due to it being a blended bourbon, thereby creating a much more interesting whiskey than many come to expect in that price range. Is it better than the once $20 stalwarts of Buffalo Trace, Four Roses, or Maker’s Mark? Probably not, as it simply doesn’t have the age or oak backbone that those do, but it’s no less interesting either. Fistful of Bourbon probably isn’t going to replace your favorite drinker or limited edition gem, but it might have a chance of becoming your new favorite budget drinker.","Utilizing five different bourbons to create Fistful of Bourbon’s blend, results in a surprisingly layered bourbon at a rock-bottom price.","William Grant & Sons cleverly took what’s been done with scotch regarding blending from multiple sources, applied it to bourbon, and marketed it as something new and unique. Of course this has also been a common practice with bourbon, but it's never quite been used as a product’s forward-facing selling point as much as Fistful of Bourbon leans on it. At the same time, its budget price point makes it come across as a potential grab bag of bourbons hastily thrown together to cash in on bourbon’s ever-growing popularity. Except in this case, William Grant & Sons wisely took one of their key assets in veteran master blender Brian Kinsman, and employed his skills to create something you wouldn’t expect from a budget bourbon. This will likely exceed your expectations of what a $25 bourbon can offer, but to be fair, it’s also not going to completely blow you away either. Some of the luster it offered during my first few visits with it began to wear off over time. This isn’t going to go down as a hidden gem like the Weller brand used to be, or other hidden gems that only those in the know, know about. Instead, it's a budget bourbon that offers more than it has any right to, in a time when good inexpensive bourbons have become a relic of the past.",Eric,2.5,3,2.5,3,3,2.5,https://www.breakingbourbon.com/review/fistful-of-bourbon
,Four Roses Super Premium,Classification: Straight Bourbon,Company: Kirin Brewery Company,Distillery: Four Roses,Released: Ongoing,Proof: 86,Age: NAS,Mashbill: Undisclosed,Color:  Light Copper,MSRP: $50 (2015),Official Website,"This bourbon is one of two Four Roses products that are sold only in Japan, with the other being Four Roses Black Label. While this may seem odd, it is important to note that in February 2002, the Kirin Brewery Company of Japan purchased the Four Roses brand trademark from Diageo.

Four Roses Super Premium is a completely different product than what you can buy in the U.S. While it uses the same traditional Four Roses recipes, the percentages are different than what you will find in a Four Roses Yellow or Four Roses Small Batch in the U.S. It’s rumored that Super Premium uses several of the recipes, and 80% of the Bourbon must have been aged a minimum of 8 years while 20% aged 10 years or greater. The bourbon is dumped from the barrel at the Four Roses distillery in Kentucky and then sent over to Kirin in Japan for bottling and distribution.

Additionally while this is an export-only bourbon, it is bottled at 750ml versus the standard 700ml that many other export-only bourbons are bottled at, including Four Roses Black Label. The bottle contains the classic embossed Four Roses flower symbol that can be found on other bottlings, however the symbol itself is made of a light metal versus glass. Incidentally, this bourbon is also sometimes referred to as Four Roses “Platinum.”","Lighter, with floral and sweet notes along with the faintest hint of alcohol. All of your classic bourbon profile flavors are present with toasted brown sugar, vanilla, and light oak immediately jumping out. Behind these flavors lay hints of peaches and light crisp summer fruits. While it’s not deep, it’s subtle and pleasant and everything you’d expect out of a well-rounded Four Roses bourbon. Letting this sit out for 20-30 minutes really opens up the nose and the floral and sweet notes are enhanced with time in the glass.","The sweetness of the nose carries right through into the palate. Here the fruit characteristics found in the nose shine through a bit brighter, along with a healthy dose of vanilla and the slightest touch of oak. While Four Roses Super Premium may be lighter in proof than what one might be used to when drinking a Four Roses Small Batch or Single Barrel, it certainly doesn’t taste watered down. The palate won’t blow anyone away, however it’s a simple, sweet profile that I feel any novice or experienced bourbon drinker would appreciate and find quite enjoyable.","The finish is short to medium in length, and brings with it a nice little set of flavors to ponder over. It starts light and sweet with honey and vanilla upfront. Over the next minute it then morphs to the drier side with aged oak and leather shining through, along with a dash of white pepper until it fades away. The finish is good, however it’s one of those bourbons that you have to keep going back and sipping if you want to get another dose flavors due to the lightness of it.","There are are a few ways of looking at uniqueness for this Four Roses Super Premium. One group of individuals will say that it’s very unique due to the fact that you can only get it in Japan. Ironically enough, even though this can only be bought in Japan, the text on the front of the bottle is written entirely in English along with half the text on the back. In a weird twist, it’s almost begging to be exported back to the U.S.

Another set of individuals will say it’s not that unique and it’s really just another Four Roses blend that’s slightly different than the Four Roses Yellow or Small Batch variants offered in the U.S. Yes the recipe blend is different than what is sold here, however at the end of the day it’s still made up of a mixture of the various recipes that make up all of the other Four Roses products.

Finally there is a third way to look at this, which is where I tend to lean. Yes, much like Blanton’s Special Reserve, just because it’s only sold outside of the U.S., doesn’t automatically make it inherently special. Unlike Blanton’s Special Reserve however, this bourbon has legs to stand on. It can hold its own against the other products in the Four Roses line, including while not being an equal peer, the Single Barrel variant. While the bourbon is slightly more sweet than the Four Roses line found in the U.S., the floral and sweet flavor profile isn’t so unique that there’s nothing else on the market like it. If you’re after well balanced floral and sweet, you can just as well find it other bourbons on the market with Blanton’s Single Barrel coming to mind as one example.","At $50 a bottle before taxes in Japan (or shipping & import fees elsewhere in the world), it’s right on target for what this should cost. Sure it’s higher by about $20 than a bottle of Four Roses Small Batch that can be bought in the U.S., however these are two different bourbons that are formulated and priced for two very different markets. That being said, I wouldn’t pay a dollar more for this bourbon than its normal price. For one, you can buy a bottle of Four Roses Single Barrel for less which is a different but better bourbon between the two for the price. If you want a bottle and happen to be in Japan, or have a friend who can get you a bottle on their travels, then by all means pay the asking price. However unless you’re a diehard Four Roses fan who wants to add this to your collection, pass on paying anything more for this.","This Japan-only bourbon is good, however not worth going out of your way to track down a bottle, especially at anything above the MSRP in Japan.","If you’re a diehard Four Roses fan, then this is a must have bourbon to add to your collection. However for everyone else, know that you’re not missing out on anything inherently special here. Yes this is a tasty bourbon, however you can just as easily go buy a bottle of Four Roses Small Batch and you’ll be getting just as good an experience from the Four Roses family. A unique novelty to try if you see it, Four Roses Super Premium above all else shows that no matter how you blend the various Four Roses recipes, you’re almost guaranteed to get a nice drinkable bourbon.",Jordan,3,3,2.5,2.5,2.5,2.5,https://www.breakingbourbon.com/review/four-roses-super-premium
,Four Roses Yellow Label,Classification: Straight Bourbon,Company: Kirin Brewery Company,Distillery: Four Roses,Released: Ongoing,Proof: 80,Age: NAS,"Mashbill: Blend of 75% Corn, 20% Rye, 5% Malted Barley and 60% Corn, 35% Rye, 5% Malted Barley",Color:  Light Amber,MSRP: $20 (2017),Official Website,"Four Roses uses 2 different mash bills and 5 different yeast strains to create 10 unique bourbon recipes. All 10 of the recipes are typically blended together to create Yellow, however there are times when not all 10 recipes are used in each batch. The Q yeast strain is described as having and essence of floral aromas, of which there are 2 Q recipes, OESQ and OBSQ (1 for each mash bill), which are considered “flavoring recipes.” These recipes make up a small portion of Four Roses’ overall production and consequently a small portion of the Yellow blend, typically ranging from 1.5 - 3.5%. When supplies are short and the desired flavor profile has already been achieved, Four Roses may forego one or both of these additional flavoring recipes in the blend. As a result the Yellow blend will include 8 - 10 of the Four Roses recipes depending on the batch.

The Yellow batch size ranges from 200 - 400 barrels. The average age of the bourbons by batch is about 5 ½ years, with the barrels typically ranging from as young as 4 years to as old as 12 years. Four Roses uses single story rickhouses to age their bourbon in barrels that have undergone a 45 second burn (resulting in a char level that falls between #3 and #4).",A floral undertone provides the base for the aromas. Hints of apple and pear lay atop the delicate floral base. A bit of ethanol is present but it doesn’t overtake the other scents.,"On the palate this bourbon is soft and lightweight, though it has a nice mouthfeel. Flavors are subtle and well integrated with one another. As a result, it can be described as simply having a fruity, floral essence. The flavors are so well balanced and delicate, it’s nearly impossible to zero in on any one specifically.","Crisp with the fruit and floral characteristics dissipating quickly. A light spice takes their place, and though it’s very soft it lingers pleasantly for some time.","While the flavor profile of Yellow could be considered well balanced and in a sense flawless, it also lacks any characteristics that would make it stand out. Combined with it’s low proof, Yellow is very easy to sip and integrates well into cocktails without overtaking the other ingredients. Based on Yellow’s position in Four Roses’ standard lineup along with its complicated creation process, it’s safe to assume this is by design with the final product being precisely what the company wants it to be.

The creation process for Yellow is not only unique in the industry, but rather intriguing when you consider it relative to the final product. Seeing as how 8 to 10 of the Four Roses’ unique recipes are blended together to make each Yellow batch, you might expect an onslaught of different flavors. Instead the opposite is true. Of course the various recipes used ultimately provide the base of flavors for the bourbon. However, the use of multiple recipes also serves to mute the unwanted characteristics and imperfections that each individual recipe or barrel might bring to the blend, allowing for meticulous control and consistency from batch to batch.","$20 a bottle for Four Roses Yellow is more than fair as long as expectations are kept in check. Unlike some of the comparably priced Bottled in Bond (BiB) bourbons we’ve reviewed, Yellow is 20 proof points lower and generally has a more balanced, yet less exciting flavor profile by comparison, making it more ideal for mixing. Four Roses’ own Small Batch, the next bottle in their standard portfolio which retails for approximately $10 more than Yellow, is bottled at a higher proof and provides a more interesting flavor profile for those looking to sip neat. Yellow is ideal for anyone who enjoys a more delicate sip or simply wants a mixer that promises not to overpower the drink. While it won’t offend anyone, it probably won’t excite anyone either.","Four Roses Yellow is a quality budget-friendly bourbon that’s easy to like and ideal for cocktails, but because of it’s low proof and subtle flavor profile, it’s not exciting enough to really love.","Four Roses seems to succeed in everything they do and maintains careful control over their unique process, which is arguably the envy of the industry. Being their budget-friendly entry level bourbon, Yellow is high in quality, though its low proof and lack of unique flavor characteristics make it more ideal as a mixer than a sipper. I would recommend anyone who has not tried it yet or who has not had it in a while seek out a bottle of Yellow, if for no other reason than to experience the end product of this unique curation process and as something to have on hand as a versatile cocktail base. Furthermore, if any of the good folks at Four Roses happen to be listening, I would be very interested to experience what a barrel proof version of Yellow tastes like.

,Hancock’s President's Reserve Single Barrel Bourbon,Classification: Bourbon,Company: Sazerac Company,Distillery: Buffalo Trace,Release Date: Ongoing,Proof: 88.9,Age: NAS,Mashbill: Undisclosed (Buffalo Trace “Mashbill #2” - Higher Rye 12% - 15%),Color: Light Gold,MSRP: $50,Official Website,"Hancock’s President’s Reserve is one of several single barrel bourbons distilled at the Buffalo Trace Distillery and is said to supposedly utilize the company's high rye mashbill. According to Sazerac, “In 1775, the Leestown settlement was established along the banks of the Kentucky River by Willis and Hancock Lee. Soon this became a well-known shipping port for tobacco, hemp and whiskey. The Single Barrel Bourbon Whiskey pays tribute to the pioneering spirit of Hancock Lee.”","Hay and light oak lead the way. A good swirl of the glass and a deeper inhale reveal hints of vanilla and cinnamon, along with a whiff of peach. There is also an undertone of ethanol, which is surprising considering the bourbon’s lower proof. It's an acceptable yet forgettable way to be introduced to the pour.","The sip greets you with a noticeably thin palate. Cinnamon and dashes of sweet vanilla are instantly noticeable. These however struggle against tannic oak and black pepper spice, which constantly try to swat away these sweeter flavors as they bubble up. This is quite surprising as you normally don’t get this level of spice out of a bourbon clocking in below 90 proof.","Dry oak and leather lead the way and mingle with a noticeable dash of peppercorn spice. Vanilla and butterscotch hard candy make a flash of an appearance before the drier flavors take back over. Thankfully, the finish is on the short side, as the dryness borders on off-putting by the end.","Hancock’s President’s Reserve is the most head-scratching bourbon coming out of the Buffalo Trace Distillery. I don’t say that lightly, since they’ve had a number of releases over the last few years that have made me think that. For a company that releases as many talked-about releases as Sazerac does, it’s odd the lack of discussion about this release. It doesn’t help that Buffalo Trace doesn’t even list it on its website and you have to go to an offshoot Sazerac website to get a small backstory about this bourbon.

And then there’s the nondescript bottle design. If you weren’t familiar with the brand, you’re likely to look past it without giving it a second look. The label and bottle isn’t particularly noteworthy, and it isn’t until you read the small print at the bottom of the back label that you learn it was distilled by Buffalo Trace.

Additionally, Hancock’s President’s Reserve joins a plethora of other supposed Buffalo Trace mashbill #2 single barrel bourbons including Elmer T. Lee, the entire Blanton’s line, and Rockhill Farms. While Buffalo Trace bottles Blanton’s Special Reserve for the international market at a  low of 80 proof, Hancock’s President’s Reserve is the lowest proof among single barrel mashbill #2 bourbons sold in the U.S.

These odd choices might have made sense at some point, but it’s truly lost on the consumer now. Given its oddly low proof, lackluster backstory, and nondescript label, all of these taken together are what actually makes this strangely unique for a single barrel bourbon from Buffalo Trace Distillery and not the actual bourbon in the bottle.","The majority of Buffalo Trace mashbill #2 products fall within the $40-$60 range if you can find them at MSRP. Hancock’s President’s Reserve is no exception falling smack dab in the middle at $50.

Buffalo Trace’s mashbill #2 bourbons aren’t exactly easy to come by lately. Hancock’s President’s Reserve isn’t a common bottle to find due to its low key appearance and lack of notoriety, yet it is possible to stumble across one. This might lead many people to think that it’s a great value at only $50. That said, just because you can buy it doesn’t mean you should. At $50, there’s a number of other Buffalo Trace products I would recommend before this, and certainly a number of other brands for equal or less.","The odd man out in Buffalo Trace Distillery’s lineup of single barrel bourbons, Hancock’s President’s Reserves delivers a forgettable pour to go along with its equally forgettable appearance.","Hancock’s President’s Reserve comes in at only 1.1 proof points lower than Elmer T. Lee - an odd choice - but also one that also shows how big of a difference a single proof point can make. While I generally find most bottles of Elmer T. Lee offer a consistently approachable pour that’s above average to very good, it turns out that 90 proof and above may just be the magic number to succeed with this mashbill.

Hancock’s President’s Reserve delivers an average-at-best pour that makes you wonder why this bottle is being released. Its thin spice filled palate will be a deal breaker for some, and gave me pause throughout the various times I sat with this bourbon. Since it is a single barrel bourbon you may get an exceptional single barrel here and there, but more likely it will be one of those bourbons that you buy, have a glass or two, and then quickly have it become forgotten as it migrates to the back of your liquor cabinet.",Jordan,2.5,2.5,2,2.5,2,2.5,https://www.breakingbourbon.com/review/hancocks-presidents-reserve-single-barrel-bourbon
,Heaven Hill 27 Year Barrel Proof,Classification: Straight Bourbon,Company: Heaven Hill,Distillery: Old Heaven Hill Springs Distillery,Released: Fall 2018,Proof:  94.7,Age: 27 Years,"Mashbill: 78% Corn, 12% Malted Barley, 10% Rye",Color: Deep Amber,MSRP: $400 (2018),Official Website,"Heaven Hill 27 Year Barrel Proof Small Batch Bourbon was produced at the Old Heaven Hill Springs Distillery before it was destroyed by a fire in 1996. As such, it is referred to as “pre-fire” Heaven Hill bourbon. The release is comprised of 41 barrels that were produced in 1989 and 1990. All but five of the barrels comprising this release were aged on the first and second floors of Heaven Hill’s rickhouses, where the conditions were such that the proof decreased over time. As a result, when all of the barrels were combined it resulted in an unusually low barrel proof of only 94.7. Less than 3,000 bottles were produced, which equates to evaporation loss of approximately 73% or more. This one-time release bourbon was made available to limited markets in the fall of 2018.","Woody aromas are most prominent. Seasoned wood, cigar box, and aged oak comprise the overall aroma, along with hints of tobacco. It lacks the typical sweeter notes often found in bourbon, such as caramel and vanilla, but that’s not to say the woody aroma is overdone. Additionally, the nose notably lacks a general funkiness that is sometimes found in older bourbons, instead highlighting an array of woody scents in a rather straightforward but approachable manner.","Aged wood tannins bite hard. It’s immediately dry in an unusually upfront way. There are undertones of sweeter characteristics that tease a bit, but don’t wholeheartedly come into play. It’s rather robust, and turns towards a spicy note as its rolled around in the mouth. This robustness is characteristically unusual for such an old and, relatively speaking, low proof bourbon. After repeated sips, I’m able to get past the initial shock and the wood tannins come off less and less harsh, allowing me to tease out seasoned oak, tobacco, and hints of caramel.","The finish starts with big spice and an in-your-face dryness at first, which then fades to a complex integration of flavors. Lead by aged oak, cigar box, and tobacco, traces of leather and a light smokiness are also present. It’s anything but smooth at the start, but once the initial bite fades, you’re rewarded with a long and rather complex finish.","It’s 27 years old, limited production, pre-fire Heaven Hill, and unusually low barrel proof…but you already know that. There are few bourbons brought to market in this age range, and even fewer that are easily comparable. Heaven Hill’s own Parker’s Heritage 24 Year Bottled In Bond is a good comparison, as is Orphan Barrel’s Old Blowhard. Some of you might also remember Parker’s Heritage 27 Year, a shocking example of just how good high aged bourbon can be and notably the closest comparable bourbon. Finally, the elusive Pappy Van Winkle, a line of high aged bourbons that, admittedly, succeed in handling their high age quite well (though they’re not quite as old and have wheat versus rye as the secondary grain in the mashbill).

To that end, I will say this. Where the high aged Pappy Van Winkle are sometimes a bit oaky, they’re also velvety smooth lacking harshness or bitterness and rich in complexity. WhereOrphan Barrel’s Old Blowhard was a bit tannic and arguably over-oaked, it also felt a little watered down and over-filtered, which makes it quite drinkable. Parker’s Heritage 27 Year is full of rich, aged bourbon flavor, but doesn’t overdo it making for one of the best high aged bourbons I've ever had.

Parker’s Heritage 24 Year Bottled In Bond is the most recent similar high aged Heaven Hill release, so I compared it side by side with Heaven Hill 27 Year. Bottled In Bond is more refined and less oaky, though wood flavors still make up much of the flavor profile. The Parker’s Heritage 24 Year Bottled In Bond is more well rounded and balanced, while the Heaven Hill 27 Year is more robust and wood-forward in its delivery. This characteristic separates Heaven Hill 27 Year from every bourbon I just listed, as it’s the only bourbon over 20 years that I’ve ever had that comes across so brash and unrefined. Taking this as it is, I have to give Heaven Hill credit for not being tempted to over-filter or proof this down. However, the result is a bourbon that’s quite unusual and raw and tannic in its delivery. Needless to say, it’s not for everyone and takes getting past an initial shock factor to find something to appreciate. Every other bourbon listed here arguably handled its high age more elegantly.","Heaven Hill offers a strong range of value bourbons and whiskeys, which includes their recently retired 6 year old Bottled In Bond Bourbon, Henry McKenna 10 Year, and many more. For limited releases, they tend to price them around $10 per year of aging, with Old Fitzgerald Bottled In Bond and Parker’s Heritage 24 Year Bottled In Bond being a few recent examples. Heaven Hill 27 Year comes in above that, at $400 which is about $15 per year of aging. But it’s unlikely many who choose to purchase this will consider that a deterrent.

The fact is, this is a collector’s bourbon. Given its age, the uniquely crafted packaging (which notably resembles scotch packaging), and the fact that it’s $400 right out of the gate doesn’t even matter. Those who want it will buy it, probably for more than MSRP.

For the rest of us, it’s a fun example of what high aged bourbon can taste like, but beyond the initial curiosity phase it’s hardly a bourbon that will be admired for its flavor profile when taking price into consideration. To that end, it’s a poor use of $400.","Heaven Hill 27 Year shocks the palate with a unique delivery of wood-forward flavors, but fails to justify its asking price.","I like that Heaven Hill 27 Year was released at barrel proof. I like that it’s not over-filtered. I like that it provides a different experience than other high aged bourbons I’ve had. But the price, which was inevitable, is not justified by the bourbon in the bottle. Other bourbons I mentioned, like the high aged Van Winkles and Parker’s Heritage 27 Year, are bourbons that were (and are) expensive. But beyond the sticker shock lie bourbons that are tremendously good. With Heaven Hill 27 Year if you’re looking for a well-rounded bourbon you won’t find it here. Instead, it’s an onslaught of wood flavors delivered in a rather potent way. While the Heaven Hill 27 Year did grow on me the more I sipped it, it was admittedly more of an interest in its unusual flavor profile than pure enjoyment of it. At the price point, that’s just not enough.

,Heaven Hill 7 Year Bottled in Bond,Classification: Straight Bourbon,Company: Heaven Hill,Distillery: Heaven Hill,Release Date: October 2019,Proof: 100,Age: 7 Years,"Mashbill: 78% Corn, 12% Malted Barley, 10% Rye",Color: Medium Amber,Price: $40 (2019),Official Website,"Until 2019, Heaven Hill released a 6 year old Bottled in Bond bourbon available exclusively in Kentucky. Readily available for $12-$15, we awarded it 5 barrels for value. In 2018, when Heaven Hill announced it would be discontinued, a wave a sadness was shared among bourbon enthusiasts who were upset to see it go. However, at such an incredible value, it always seemed too good to be true.

On June 24, 2019 Heaven Hill announced the details of the bourbon that would replace the now retired 6 year old fan favorite. Aged for an additional year, and sporting an updated label, the new Heaven Hill Bottled-in-Bond would become the flagship bourbon for the company. It is available in California, Texas, New York, Georgia, Florida, Illinois, South Carolina, and Colorado first. Notably Kentucky, Heaven Hill’s home state and once the exclusive state to obtain the age stated Bottled-in-Bond bourbon, is not included in the initial product release. See the company press release for more information.","Quintessential aromas of vanilla, caramel, and aged oak come forward. A trace of leather along with even fainter hints of tobacco and honey play in the background. It’s a little light considering the proof, but well balanced and pleasant overall.","Seasoned oak and spice envelop the taste buds, bursting forth immediately. Savory tobacco and leather notes come next, balanced against graham cracker and butterscotch. It has a lightweight, and somewhat dry mouthfeel. Despite this, the intensity of flavors is just right, inviting you back for more.","Medium to long, cinnamon spice and caramel sweetness find themselves in perfect balance to start it off. Oak mingles in, along with cherries and vanilla sweetness. The dryness present in the palate tapers off, allowing the sweeter notes to echo into the final moments of the finish. Nice overall, and quintessentially bourbon-esque.","Undoubtedly the biggest question is how this new 7 year release compares to its 6 year predecessor. With the same mashbill, proof, Bottled in Bond designation, and the fact that it was released approximately one year after the Kentucky-only 6 year old was discontinued suggests the only difference between the two bottlings is the additional year of aging. Not surprisingly, the 7 year is a tad drier, with a bit more oak pulling away from the sweet and spicy notes more prominent in the 6 year old. But overall, they are marginally different. Each is a quintessential bourbon in every sense of the word, and while enjoyable, unequivocally average.","While the packaging is different, the screw cap has been replaced with a cork, and a year of age has been added, the elephant in the room is this bourbon’s very similar predecessor that retailed for only $12 per bottle. A relic held over from ages past, it was one of the few remaining reminders of a time when bourbon was in far less demand than it is today. Being available only in Kentucky, it was out of reach for many and considered a sort of gift from Heaven Hill to Kentucky, especially considering its ridiculously low price. While I regularly stocked up every opportunity I had, I also frequently brought a bottle to parties, using it to introduce others to bourbon, the concept of Bottled in Bond, and then leaving it for the host to discover later. For the quality relative to price, it was easily bourbon’s best value and having one felt, well, kind of special.

At $40 MSRP and what will eventually be, presumably, a nationwide release, the bottle in review is a whole different animal. First and foremost, I want to be clear that I don’t harbor any ill-will or resentment about this towards Heaven Hill. $12 for the previous version was undoubtedly a gift, and was sure to come to an end one day. However, with that low price, respectable quality, and Kentucky-only availability somehow made it magical. With the re-release of the 7 year that magic is gone. Instead, it’s a decent flagship bourbon that will appeal to the masses. An approachable quintessential bourbon flavor profile, welcomed age statement, and Bottled in Bond designation all serve to represent Heaven Hill well. While I will likely keep a bottle on hand going forward, unfortunately I won’t get that feeling I once did each time I pour a glass. Sure it adds depth to a collection, but it’s ultimately an average value if not even priced slightly high to accommodate for some inflation in the market. Moreover, at $40 it faces steep competition including the likes of Knob Creek Single Barrel, Eagle Rare 10 Year, and for much less, Wild Turkey 101.","While the magic of its predecessor might be lost, the re-release of Heaven Hill’s flagship product will represent the company well in the eyes of the masses.","Many bourbon drinkers were disappointed when Heaven Hill discontinued the 6 year old Kentucky-only Bottled in Bond bourbon. And for some, this re-release feels like Heaven Hill simply decided they wanted to charge more. While it is curious this was not initially released in Kentucky, the remainder of the attributes associated with the re-release make perfect sense as it seemed inevitable. Those who never had the opportunity to try the discontinued version can now get a taste of what they were missing, albeit after one more year of aging and for a much higher price. However with a higher price tag and what will most likely become ready availability nationwide, I feel many will wonder what the fuss was about. Instead, what they will discover is a decent bourbon that is no longer worth getting overly excited about.

Currently the White Label Bottled in Bond (BiB) sports a 6 year age statement. Due to fluctuating stock levels, this brand has been known to frequently lose its age statement, but regain it not long after.

This is also a BiB bourbon. To be labelled BiB, the whiskey must be the product of one distillation season and one distiller at a single distillery, aged in a federally bonded warehouse under U.S. government supervision for at least four years, and it must be bottled at exactly 100 proof. Additionally, the BiB label must clearly identify the distillery where it was distilled and where it was bottled, if different.","Notes of honey, vanilla, corn, and oak are the main draw, while fainter hints of citrus, brown sugar, and leather linger in the background. It’s very hard to dislike this nose as it’s filled with sweet and agreeable flavors. Overall a nice quality to the scents, but a bit surprising how weak they come across considering the proof.","A somewhat shocking amount of oak at the forefront tends to overshadow the other flavors entirely. Butterscotch, rye spice, and a tad of mint fight for attention. The bourbon is on the thin side, but not as detrimental as you would expect. It’s smooth and has a lightweight consistency. It may flirt with being too familiar and simply average, yet it’s all-too-easy to come back for more.","A warming burn comes across on the medium length finish that’s dominated by oak notes. Cinnamon spice lingers, which is offset by sweet caramel notes, but neither gains much attention over the oak. Enjoyable finish, just not that exciting.","The bourbon itself is an average affair. It won’t surprise you, nor challenge you, yet it’s extremely easy to drink and enjoy. It’s hard to find any crippling faults with it besides its mild impact. Mainly this will serve as an everyday drinker or a table bourbon as whiskey writer Lew Bryson calls them. I have a hard time believing anyone would honestly dislike this bourbon if they enjoy drinking whiskey. But will they love and remember it? Probably not for it’s flavor, but maybe for it’s price.","Tasting this blind, I would expect the majority of people to incorrectly guess its MSRP. Too many have spent their formative years drinking way-to-cheap vodka and rum to have any amount of respect for a similar priced whiskey. Many bourbon consumers have been conditioned to exclude anything on the bottom shelf at a store, which generally falls in the $15 or less category. The fact that this can still be bought for under $15 with a 6 year age statement, and be of decent quality will shock even a seasoned whiskey drinker. Sure the whiskey itself is a tad thin and the flavors aren’t as pronounced as much as one would like, but at 100 proof and with almost no alcohol notes for a bourbon this inexpensive, you really have to try hard to find something to dislike with this whiskey.","A quality bourbon that might not blow your mind, but the price sure will.","The fact that Heaven Hill BiB can be found for less than $15 would shake my world if I were a craft whiskey distiller. How does one compete against a product like this? I remember reading a while ago a quote that said whiskey drinkers should consider themselves lucky that they are able to purchase a bottle of their favorite type of spirit, one that’s been aged for a number of years, that is of decent quality, and at a relative low price. Heaven Hill BiB is a prime example of this: a Bottled in Bond, 6 year old bourbon for around $12. Do I feel lucky? I definitely do with a bottle like this. The real shame is how hard this is to find outside Kentucky and that most people won’t be lucky enough to get to try it.",Eric,2.5,2.5,2.5,2.5,5,2.5,https://www.breakingbourbon.com/review/heaven-hill-bottled-in-bond
,Jack Daniel's Tennessee Rye,Classification: Straight Rye,Company: Brown-Forman,Distillery: Jack Daniel's Distillery,Released: October 2017/Ongoing,Proof: 90,Age: NAS,"Mashbill: 70% Rye, 18% Corn, 12% Malted Barley",Color: Copper,MSRP: $27 (2018),Official Website,"Jack Daniel’s created their “first new grain bill in 100 years” for their rye whiskey line. Tennessee Rye is the company’s fourth rye release. They started with Unaged Rye in 2012, Rested Rye in 2014, and Single Barrel Rye in 2016. According to the company, the whiskey uses the same cave spring water from the Jack Daniel’s Hollow and proprietary yeast that’s been used in the distillery’s 150-year-old Tennessee Whiskey recipe. The rye is aged in the upper regions of their barrel house where it’s exposed to increased temperature variation. The Single Barrel Rye was thought to be 4 years old and the Tennessee Rye is believed to include some 5 year old stock in its blend, although the company hasn’t officially stated this. Jack Daniel’s has confirmed with us they have no plans to discontinue the Single Barrel Rye now that Tennessee Rye is on the shelves.","Immediately out of the gate there’s a commanding presence of cherry, banana, hay, and custard. It mostly forgoes traditional rye notes and only fleetingly sports any spice and grain - not that there’s anything wrong with that. This is another Jack rye that bucks traditional expectations and presents an eccentric set of aromas that is both pleasant and unexpected.","A heavy dose of banana that's immediately followed by...more banana. Oak notes sweep in from time to time which can make this taste almost like banana nut bread. It’s largely a smooth drinking experience that sports a medium-thick mouthfeel. As the banana subsides, a bit of grain cereal come to the forefront. It’s a little strange tasting but interesting nevertheless.",It’s odd in that this mild finish is lacking in both flavor and mouthfeel. It’s a very straightforward affair with a singular focus on oak and accompanying dryness. The lack of spice is really felt on the finish because it would have added an extra dimension that’s missing. The weak flavor body of its finish does this whiskey a great disservice.,"Jack Daniel’s once again deserves credit for a unique tasting rye whiskey that stands out from other ryes on the market. But that will only get them so far and benefit them for so long. For a batched product, a good amount of what made their Single Barrel Rye great can still be tasted here, but clearly some of those characteristics were lost in the batching process. Its mouthfeel is nowhere near as creamy, and while still fruit-forward, it lacks the same intensity.  It’s overall a more straightforward rye that most notably sports more banana notes than probably any other rye whiskey on the market.","There’s been a flood of rye whiskey hitting the market over the past few years with many falling in the $25-$35 price range. The thing is, the many of them have also been largely forgettable. From the start, Jack Daniel’s rye products have tasted different. With each passing year and a perceived additional year of aging, they continually show signs of improvement.

I noted in my Single Barrel Rye review that it was “a unique tasting and buttery rye that’s already showing signs of greatness even at a young age.” I also noted that I couldn’t get behind its $50 price tag and a batched product might remedy this. I didn't expect a year later the company would do just that, and even price it at a very reasonable $27. Part of me figured the whiskey might take a hit in quality - and it did - but at almost half the price, isn’t that acceptable? For its price, its complexity is very much in line with many of its peers, but its unique Jack Daniel’s Rye flavor profile is what makes it much more memorable for me and will most likely be my new go to sub $35 sipping rye. However, comparing it directly to Jack’s other ryes, if cost isn’t an issue, the Single Barrel Rye is still superior in every way.","Despite losing a lot of characteristics going from a single barrel to a small batch, Jack Daniel’s Tennessee Rye is still one of the more unique tasting ryes on the market at an enticing price.","There is no denying that this is a unique tasting rye even if you compare it to ryes twice its price. The problem is that Jack Daniel’s released a superior rye product last year, which takes some of the thunder away from Tennessee Rye. Maybe if we hadn’t experienced it last year, this batched product would stand out more. I’m curious why the company decided to release a superior and more expensive product first before releasing this one. Typically whiskey companies do it the other way around. Nevertheless, standing on its own it’s undoubtedly a fine tasting product at a great price. Its finish is easily its weakest link, but its other parts are strong enough to keep the whole thing afloat.

It’s still early in Jack’s adventure into rye making, and with the company releasing a different rye product every year, a lot could change over the next few years. For now, this is yet another rye from Jack Daniel’s that shows a lot of promise, but at some point the company will need to prove themselves with a product that can stand on its own and go up against the best in the rye category. That may still be a few years down the road, but for a company as tried and true as Jack Daniel’s, they’ve been surprisingly whimsical with their rye product so far. While Jack’s Tennessee Rye doesn’t quite shine as bright as it could, it nevertheless still shines in its own unique way.",Eric,3,2.5,2,3,3,2.5,https://www.breakingbourbon.com/review/jack-daniels-tennessee-rye
,Jack Daniel’s Tennessee Whiskey,Classification: Tennessee Whiskey,Company: Brown-Forman,Distillery: Jack Daniel’s Distillery,Release Date: Ongoing,Proof: 80,Age: NAS,"Mashbill: 80% Corn, 12% Malted Barley, 8% Rye",Color: Molasses  ,MSRP: $22 (2019),Official Website,"Jack Daniel’s was established in 1886, and is the top-selling American whiskey in the world. It is produced in Lynchburg, Tennessee which ironically, is a dry county meaning the product can’t actually be sold there. Brown-Forman acquired Jack Daniel’s in 1956.

While not officially labelled straight bourbon, most of Jack Daniel’s whiskeys meet the criteria required to be called a straight bourbon. After distillation, Jack Daniel’s Tennessee Whiskey undergoes what is referred to as the ‘Lincoln County Process.’ Jack Daniel’s allows its whiskey to drip for six days in 10-foot vats, passing through charcoal that was made by burning maple wood that had been impregnated with 140 proof Jack Daniel’s whiskey, before being put in new charred oak barrels and aged for an estimated 4-7 years. Jack Daniel’s Tennessee Whiskey was once bottled at 86 proof, but in 2004, was lowered to 80 proof.","A pleasant mix of fruity sweetness, vanilla custard, oak, and banana. It’s medium in intensity, yet still has a decent richness to it  Apricot and corn provide an additional layer of nuance. These scents culminate into an enjoyable and immensely satisfying opening to this whiskey.","A rush of corn and banana upfront that’s followed by sugary blend of vanilla and walnut. Minor traces of smoke, cinnamon, and maple creep in and help add some additional nuance. Although its thin mouthfeel is regrettable and 80 proof unappealing, it thankfully drinks ever so slightly hotter. This all adds up to a palate that is distinctly Jack and makes it surprisingly fun to drink.","Forgoing much of the sweetness found in its palate, the finish is oaky, slightly bitter, and at times almost briney. It’s a strong contrast to the sweet nose and palate, and leaves a mildly dry and tongue zapping funkiness that’s a hard contrast to the other parts of this whiskey. It’s a detrimental finish to an otherwise solid overall pour.","A lot of fun has been had arguing whether the standard Jack Daniel’s qualifies as bourbon or not. But the discussion always comes back to the Lincoln County Process. Some may say that it hides flaws that would otherwise be more pronounced, but that is largely inconsequential as so many other brands use many different means of filtering. Jack Daniel’s has also been making whiskey for 150 years and it’s hard to argue that after perfecting their technique for so long, that they make poor products. This is highlighted by their entry into rye production and how impressive their rye products have been out of the gate.  

As for the standard Jack Daniel’s, it's quite difficult to mistake it for another average budget whiskey due to its memorable nose and unique palate, which can probably be traced back to the Lincoln County Process. Besides the brand’s quintessential banana notes, it offers a sweet and fruit-forward palate that makes it stand out and constantly reminds you you’re drinking Jack. When I compared it to a Jack Daniel’s Single Barrel Barrel Proof flavor profile, I surprisingly found more nuance with the standard’s profile. Yes it was a single barrel and barrels can vary, but the result wasn’t what I was expecting and shows the standard Jack Daniel’s does have its moments.","The standard Jack Daniel’s has always been known as a budget whiskey. That of course comes with an assumption that it’s a subpar whiskey that college kids drink because they don’t know or can’t afford any better, and with its reputation as a staple mixer with Coca-Cola. Along with brands like Jim Beam and Maker’s Mark, which can be found in just about any bar in America, it further adds to people’s assumption that these brands aren’t worth your time and money. On the flip side, the brand also has its passionate, and at times, rabid fanbase. It would seem odd for a whiskey to have such a following if it was in fact a swill whiskey. Much like I found when I reviewed Maker’s Mark, unfounded reputations certain brands carry aren’t always true. Jack Daniel’s is a superb value for the whiskey in its bottle. While I didn’t find that to be true with Jim Beam White Label, Jack Daniel’s can be a decent sipping whiskey despite its low proof and downer finish.","A flavorful and enjoyable yet flawed budget whiskey, that’s unmistakably Jack.","Jack Daniel’s Tennessee Whiskey may have its cynics, but it holds up well against some of the best of the budget sub-$30 whiskeys like Wild Turkey 101 Bourbon and Elijah Craig Small Batch. Taken as a sipping whiskey, it has an above-average nose, a likeable banana and sugary vanilla palate, but comes up short with a flawed finish. Despite being 80 proof, it thankfully drinks a bit hotter, but Brown-Forman would be well served to increase to at least 90 proof. Thankfully Brown-Forman has expanded the Jack Daniel’s portfolio and it can be quite fun doing a vertical flight of the standard Jack, single barrel, and barrel proof varieties. Many who typically shy away from this brand might come away surprised and enlightened by what it has to offer in this capacity. While you can certainly drink worse - and I know that isn’t a glowing endorsement - know this: when looking for a budget whiskey one of the best things a brand can offer are memorable characteristics. Thankfully that is something the standard Jack Daniel’s offers in spades.",Eric,3.5,2.5,1.5,3.5,3.5,2.5,https://www.breakingbourbon.com/review/jack-daniels-tennessee-whiskey
,Jefferson's Very Small Batch,Classification: Straight Bourbon,Company: Castle Brands,Distillery: Sourced (Blend of up to 4 Kentucky Straight Bourbons),Released: Ongoing,Proof: 82.3,Age: NAS,Mashbill: Undisclosed,Color:  Light Gold,MSRP: $33 (2019),Official Website,"In 1997 Trey Zoeller and his father Chet launched Jefferson’s Bourbon. Trey created the company McClain & Kyne to bottle Jefferson's which is still used to this day. In 2005, Castle Brands purchased McClain & Kyne which held ownership of the Jefferson’s name. Up until 2015, Jefferson’s was distilled by various distilleries. In 2015 Castle Brands purchased a 20% share in the Copperhead Distillery Company. Copperhead owns and operates Kentucky Artisan Distillery, which is rumored to now supply approximately 25% of the bourbon used in Jefferson’s Very Small Batch Bourbon.

While no exact ratio of barrels is given, Jefferson’s states that “four different Kentucky straight bourbon whiskies of different ages...one of the blends comprising of at least 55% of the total” are blended together to form each very small batch.  ","Classic bourbon notes of corn, vanilla, and oak are all front and center. Hiding behind are lighter floral notes and ripe plum. A simple nose that while lacking in depth, is easy to dissect and enjoy.","Slightly sweet, the palate again is on the simpler side. Vanilla and oak are the main flavors of the sip. Underneath are slight hints of honey and cherry. There’s not much depth, and the low proof doesn’t help this.","The sip ends with an extremely short finish. Light hints of vanilla and slightly aged oak are the only discernible flavors. While the nose and palate might not have set a high bar to beat, the finish isn’t even able to match them and ends the bourbon on an incredibly forgettable note.","Jefferson's has not been bashful in exploring the innovative and unique side of bourbon production, and in fact is one of the more progress brands willing to try new experimentations in the bourbon space. Their Jefferson’s Ocean Aged at Sea along with their cask finished products are some of the most innovative in the market. However while Jefferson's claim of low barrel lots in their Very Small Batch bourbon may have been unique when it was initially released, many smaller distilleries utilize a similar practice today. Its flavor profile isn’t readily distinguishable from other small batches, allowing class leaders such as Four Roses Small Batch which sells in the same price range to stand out even more. Jefferson’s Very Small Batch finds itself resting on its laurels which doesn’t propel it to stand out nowadays.","Sure the price tag may not be high, but its flavor profile, even for a $30 bourbon, is lacking. I personally would take any of the bourbons on our Best of $30 - $40 list and even many on our Best of $20 - $30 list before buying another bottle of Jefferson’s Very Small Batch. It’s not that the bourbon is discernibly bad, it’s just unfortunately playing in a very competitive price range that has some excellent everyday selections that deliver a better flavor to value ratio.","In a sea of affordable and more memorable everyday bourbons, Jefferson’s Very Small Batch’s uninspiring flavor profile fades away into the mix.","Jefferson’s Very Small Batch may very well be the definition of average bourbon. I can easily see myself pouring this for others who may just be starting off into their bourbon journey. This is because everything that experienced bourbon drinkers may dislike, the low proof and light yet discernible flavor profile, are exactly what those who don’t normally drink bourbon may appreciate.

For everyone else, “underwhelming” sums this bourbon up perfectly. The nose and palate deliver a pleasant yet simple start to the sip, however the finish ends on a completely unforgettable note. While this is common for many low proof bourbons, it’s still always disappointing to see. There's a time and place for this bourbon, but for the money I’d rather reach for many of the other fantastic bottles that play in this price range.",Jordan,2.5,2.5,2,2,2,2.5,https://www.breakingbourbon.com/review/jeffersons-very-small-batch
,Jim Beam Black XA Extra Aged,Classification: Straight Bourbon,Company: Beam Suntory,Distillery: Jim Beam Distillery,Released: Ongoing,Proof: 86,Age: NAS (said to be in the 6 year range),"Mashbill: 77% Corn, 13% Rye, 10% Malted Barley",Color:  Straw,MSRP: $25 (2017),Official Website,"In the early part of the decade, Jim Beam Black used to carry the subtitle “Double Aged” and featured an 8 year age statement. In 2015, Jim Beam dropped the age statement and changed its subtitle to “XA Extra Aged.” In mid-2016 Beam issued a portfolio-wide branding change that included new labels and bottle design. Beam slightly tweaked Black’s branding again and dropped the XA, added a hyphen, calling it “Extra-Aged.” Despite recently purchasing this bottle for review, it’s from an early-2016 release, but it is said the bourbon used for the brand has seen no further changes since the loss of its age statement in 2015.","A pleasant display of vanilla custard, candied apple, and light oak. It has a nice intensity for an 86 proof bourbon and it’s very likeable overall.","As soon as the bourbon hit my tongue it’s immediately noticeable how thin this is and the flavors seem to mimic this. Oak dominates the palate only letting in fleeting hints of vanilla and caramel. A very straightforward display of flavors that is in no way bad, just a bit boring.","Oak, smoky char, and lingering vanilla all pepper the medium-length finish. These flavors  do a decent job of sticking around despite the bourbon’s thin consistency. Again there aren’t many nuances to the flavors and they come across very matter-of-fact.","Jim Beam makes great bourbon and it’s on display in their Small Batch series which includes Knob Creek, Basil Hayden's, Baker's, and Booker’s. Based on how Jim Beam Black Extra Aged is positioned and marketed in Beam’s portfolio, it fills the gap between the inexpensive and basic Jim Beam White and the company’s more expensive and complex small batch bourbons. Extra Aged certainly offers a fuller flavor compared to Jim Beam White, but it is still miles away from Knob Creek (the least expensive of Beam’s small batch bourbons).

Beam’s namesake bourbons have always come up short for me. They’re overly simple and lack any of the richness found in Beam’s higher-tier bourbons. While that can be expected based on the large price discrepancy between the brands, the quality discrepancy is the shocking part. Buffalo Trace, Evan Williams, Heaven Hill, and Wild Turkey don’t seem to experience the same drastic dip in quality between their pricing tiers that Jim Beam does. In a vacuum, Jim Beam Black’s placement and quality might be good enough in their brand portfolio, but comparing it to the less expensive Evan Williams, equally priced Wild Turkey 101 Bourbon, or slightly more expensive Buffalo Trace and Maker’s Mark, it just doesn’t stack up. Extra Aged is simply too one-note with heavy oak dominating the already basic flavor profile it sports.","Sometimes bourbons can live a happy life maintaining a sweet spot in the bourbon market’s price structure. Amazingly, simply being a few dollars more or less than the competition can signal quality or value to the consumer. Despite the brand going through multiple name changes and losing its age statement, which suggests Beam’s struggles with the brand, it will probably survive and flourish as a classic tasting bourbon at a fair value. With bourbon’s $20 price range changing, that just might be a glimpse of Extra Aged’s future.","Offering an all around better experience than Jim Beam White, its basic flavor profile and thin consistency won’t win over many fans, but its price definitely will.","Sometimes bourbon drinkers don’t want to spend over $30 on a bourbon despite the dramatic jump in quality in the price range. Where many of us have dark memories drinking cheap alcohol in years passed, the natural starting point for many is to look for bourbon in the $20 range. There are better bourbons available that cost the same or even less, but with bourbon’s price creep in full effect, if Extra Aged can maintain its price point (helped by its NAS designation) it could become a staple in the price range. People don’t go to McDonald's for a gourmet burger, they go for convenience, and an agreeable balance of quality and value. That encapsulates Extra Aged in a nutshell.",Eric,3,2,2.5,2,2.5,2.5,https://www.breakingbourbon.com/review/jim-beam-black-xa-extra-aged
,Jim Beam Old Tub Bourbon,Classification: Straight Bourbon,Company: Beam Suntory,Distillery: Jim Beam,Release Date: June 2020,Proof: 100,Age: NAS (at least 4 years old),"Mashbill: 75% Corn, 13% Rye, 12% Malted Barley",Color: Light Gold,MSRP: $23 (2020),Official Website,"The name Old Tub holds particular meaning in the history of the Jim Beam distillery. In 1892 when James and Park Beam took over leading operations, they named the family distillery after their best-selling bourbon brand, Old Tub. The brand's name was a reference to the large mash tubs in which mash was mixed, cooked, and stirred by hand.

Jim Beam Old Tub is a non-chill filtered, non-carbon filtered, Bottled in Bond bourbon. Up until 2020, it had been continually distilled and sold only in 375ml bottles at the distillery’s gift shop in Clermont, KY. With its broader release, it is now being bottled in 750ml sizes. While billed as a limited release when it came out in June, it seems to be readily available on shelves.

To be labelled Bottled in Bond, the whiskey must be the product of one distillation season and one distiller at a single distillery, aged in a federally bonded warehouse under U.S. government supervision for at least four years, and it must be bottled at exactly 100 proof. Additionally, the Bottled in Bond label must clearly identify the distillery where it was distilled and where it was bottled, if different.

Read more in the company's Press Release.","The nose starts off with simple scents of oak, corn, vanilla, and a hint of hay. While there’s not a lot of complexity to what’s present, it owns what it does deliver. There’s also the slightest tingle of ethanol to remind you of its Bottled in Bond 100 proof.","Sweet oak, vanilla, grain, a hint of peaches, and green peppercorn mingle together with vegetable and leather undertones that try to push above the sweet oak. It provides for a thin mouthfeel overall and is simpler and sweeter in nature. Don’t confuse that for being bad, as the palate delivers just enough flavor to be mildly interesting.","A dash of rye spice along with subtle hints of peanuts, oak, and dry vanilla open the finish. The flavors hang on before eventually dropping down to an oaky rye spice medley. Medium in length, the finish is consistent with the rest of the sip in both its drinkability and averageness.","Bottled in Bond bourbons have become more common as the years have gone on. While staples such as Evan Williams Bottled in Bond, Old Grand Dad Bottled in Bond, and Henry McKenna Single Barrel have been around for years, newcomers such as Early Times Bottled in Bond and Heaven Hill Bottled in Bond have helped introduce more bourbon drinkers to the category and in their own ways raised the bar.

Flavorwise, Old Tub doesn’t stand out compared to its peers. It doesn’t offer the more noticeable sweetness of Evan Williams Bottled in Bond or the complexity that can be found in a standout Henry McKenna Single Barrel. Comparing it to its own distillery sibling Old Grand-Dad Bottled in Bond, Old Tub pulls forward a lot more wood and grain versus the spicy and sweet flavors found in Old Grand-Dad. Now while these two bourbons have different mashbills, it does go to show the differences that two Bottled in Bond bourbons that are most likely the same age, from the same distillery, can have.  

Besides the mashbill, Old Tub does have one quality though that helps set it apart from some of the other bourbons that Beam puts out, and that is the fact that Old Tub is a non-chill filtered, non-carbon filtered bourbon. What that means is that it is only screened for leftover barrel char before it’s proofed down and bottled. While this isn’t super uncommon to see, what makes this unique, is that Jim Beam typically chill filters their bourbons released at 100 proof or less. The end result has less impact on the overall flavor profile than I would have liked to have seen in this case, but it’s to be able to experience and compare against other Beam products of similar nature.","The $20 price category for bourbon is a dying breed. While you used to be able to find a consistent number of bottles in this category, over the years it’s become less common as brands have increased prices. In fact we talked about this a few years back.

It’s beyond refreshing to see Jim Beam Old Tub buck the trend and deliver a new offering to the market at an affordable $23 price tag. Additionally in a year full of high priced limited edition releases, credit needs to be given to Beam for introducing a limited edition release at this price point.

That said, compared to the similarly priced Old Grand-Dad Bottled in Bond and Early Times Bottled in Bond, Old Tub doesn’t quite match the bar they’ve set. However what Old Tubs low price point does allow for a fun comparison of chill filtered versus non-chill filtered Bottled in Bond bourbons at a low cost of entry. While it may not be the best valued Bottled in Bond bourbon in the $20 price range, the fact that its a non-chill filtered limited edition bourbon, does make this an above average value in today's marketplace.",Jim Beam Old Tub is aimed at the everyday bourbon drinker and priced accordingly so.,"Jim Beam Old Tub is not going to win any bourbon of the year awards anytime soon. In  a slowly growing sea of Bottled in Bond bourbons, Old Tub easily gets lost in the fold. Comparing its sip to others it doesn’t have any one defining quality that makes you raise even the slightest of eyebrows in appreciation.

However, what it may end up winning is a spot in value-based bourbon shoppers' hearts. The flavor profile and resulting sip is average, but the fact of the matter is, it is also very drinkable and even more affordable. As long as you’re aware what Old Tub is going into it, what you’ll find is a bourbon that can be easily enjoyed neat, or due to its very reasonable price tag, can be used in cocktails guilt-free.",Jordan,2.5,3,2,3,3,2.5,https://www.breakingbourbon.com/review/jim-beam-old-tub-bourbon

It’s actually quite pleasant. Subtle hints of corn and rye also develop as more air mixes with the bourbon. A decent about of oak also shines through.","A medium-bodied bourbon with a warm buttery smooth texture. The first sip has a good degree of alcohol flavor in it. It can be surprising but also a little off putting. What the palate lacks, the finish helps make up for.","Smokey and oaky. This has far more weight than many in its price range. It also packs a manageable amount of heat for a 90 proof bourbon. Unfortunately, it’s not a terribly complex bourbon. Flavors don’t mingle and intertwine as well as some bourbons. In some sips, the oak and the grain/corn flavors completely overpower everything else.","There’s nothing ground-breaking here, although it does stand out as a more smoky bourbon than many of its peers. Most of the time, it’s the more aged, more expensive bourbons that have this characteristic. This affordable smoky bourbon can therefore make for a decent mixer that can stand up to other ingredients that may be mixed with it.","Willett’s other entry-level bourbons: Pure Kentucky, Johnny Drum, Old Bardstown Estate all share similar traits to Kentucky Vintage. They’re all quality bourbons that are priced right. They have varying degrees of complexity yet are still far from refined. Willett’s other (more expensive) small batch bourbons, Rowan’s Creek and  Noah’s Mill are where they offer this.","Great nose, smoky flavor and priced right for a no-gimmick, everyday bourbon.","This not a bourbon that gets much fanfare. It’s rare to hear anyone talk about it. Is it due to its limited availability in parts of the country? Is it because of the complete lack of marketing and boring bottle design? It can’t because of how the bourbon tastes, because it’s right on the money in quality and price. This maybe true with a lot of bourbons, but the more time you spend with Kentucky Vintage the more you’ll love it.

Fresh cracked rye grain, green apple, and charred oak mingle together. Additionally, there’s an underlying layer of smokey syrup present. For a 100 proof rye, the nose is layered full of flavor.","Light amounts of rye grain, white pepper, citrus rinds, vanilla, pine effervescence, and oak are noticeable. The sip is light overall for a rye. It is ever so slightly spicy and not the most rye-forward sip by any means. That said, its 100 proof makes this easy to sip on and enjoy without being too hot.","Light rye spice, sweet vanilla, and oak are present at the start. The finish has a small amount of heat upfront that fades away leaving a layer of light rye and tannic oak that linger for a while. It’s a nice way to end the sip, albeit it doesn’t leave a memorable experience behind either.","Knob Creek Rye won’t jump out in a crowded field of ryes. It isn’t a unique barrel finished rye like Angel’s Envy Rye, a fruitier rye like Rittenhouse Rye Bottled in Bond, or a heavy-handed rye-forward whiskey like High West Double Rye. What it is, is a readily available rye that will scratch most people’s itch when they’re seeking out an everyday sip or a strong backbone for rye inspired cocktails. Not every whiskey can stand out from the pack and some are just content simply offering a solid pour. In this case Knob Creek Rye is about as middle of the road as you can get in terms of uniqueness.","While the flavor profile may not be overly memorable, Knob Creek Rye’s value is hard to beat. For $40 or less, you’re able to get a very easy sipping rye that isn’t overly sweet and holds back on being extremely rye forward. The lower price point allows this to easily be used in cocktails just as much as it does for pouring a glass neat.","Readily available at an affordable price, Knob Creek Rye is an easy choice when deciding on a staple rye to stock for your home bar.","Knob Creek Rye won’t blow you away by any means. What it will do though is deliver a consistent satisfying pour. Its 100 proof is welcomed, making it bold yet still very palatable. As a result it works any way you like it - neat, on the rocks, and in cocktails if you want a more traditional flavor but desire a moderate amount of additional spice and potency. Knob Creek Rye might easily be a whiskey some of us think of as too mainstream, but underneath it’s a quality rye that just about anyone can appreciate. Combined with it’s lower price point, Knob Rye is one that’s worth giving a shot at least once.

At the time, the brand had been released in low cost 100 proof Bottled-in-Bond and 80 proof forms with dated packaging. In September 2012, Heaven Hill introduced Larceny to the market as “heir to the wheated bourbons that make up the historic Old Fitzgerald franchise.” More recently, in 2018 the company introduced a premium bi-annual limited edition Old Fitzgerald Bottled-in-Bond. While the exact mashbill is not disclosed, Heaven Hill notes Larceny contains “One third more wheat than other competitors.” Notably, the name “Larceny” and key pictured on the bottle is derived from the story of John Fitzgerald, who was believed to be a Treasury agent who “used his keys to the warehouses to pilfer bourbon from the finest barrels,” which were referred to as “Fitzgerald barrels.”","Soft with an array of summer fruits: orange, apricot, and peach combined with a sweet sugarcane note. Light cinnamon also comes into play. The scents are inviting but not rich in delivery.","A delicate cinnamon spice pops at first, with baking spices and nutmeg in tow. Honey sweetness contrasts the spice notes. The mouthfeel is on the thinner side, but not so much it detracts from the experience. Despite the presence of some spice notes, the sip is quite tame, approachable, and enjoyable overall.","Cinnamon and honey carry over into the finish, and are joined by a sweet maple sugar note. Warming and medium in length, it caps the sip off nicely, maintaining the overall balance presented by this bourbon.","While the numbers are growing, bourbons with wheat as the secondary grain are still in the minority. The most popular and large production (relatively speaking) mainstays are Maker’s Mark and W.L. Weller. There are, and have been, limited release bourbons that utilize wheat as the secondary grain as well, with the Old Rip Van Winkle lineup which includes Pappy Van Winkle bourbons being the most popular. Heaven Hill also recently introduced a premium semi-annual Old Fitzgerald Bottled-in-Bond bourbon, which retails north of $100. I’m leaving off a few for sure, but the most prevalent growth in the wheated bourbon category is from craft distilleries, of which they have seen only limited distribution.

It’s been argued that few can actually decipher whether a bourbon contains wheat as the secondary grain as opposed to the much more widely utilized rye when tasted blind. In fact, it’s not uncommon to pull out the lighter sweeter notes from those rye-based bourbons since corn, the main ingredient in every bourbon’s mashbill by law, offers up a good deal of sweet notes on its own.

Narrowly focusing on the mashbill, Larceny’s most direct “wheated” competition is Maker’s Mark, considering the W.L. Weller line is no longer a readily available brand. Both Maker’s and Larceny come in around the same proof (Larceny notably two proof points higher), and around the same price. Both are marketed to the masses, come in attractive packaging (though Maker’s red wax is hard to beat), and a variety of bottle sizes. By comparison, Larceny offers a more balanced experience than Maker’s in my opinion, trading a bit of character for more widespread appeal. While you will find more polarizing opinions about Maker’s Mark, I think you’d be hard-pressed to find many who actually dislike Larceny, which, all things considered, must have been what Heaven Hill was aiming for.

To further support this theory, I tasted Larceny against some dated bottles of Old Fitzgerald 80 proof and 100 proof Bottled-in-Bond, and found Larceny to be the more balanced of the bunch.","Comparing Larceny to only wheated bourbons is only a small part of the story, as it truly competes more with bourbons of a similar price than with other same grain competitors. This is especially true since the majority of consumers would not necessarily recognize, or care about, the distinction in the mashbill, simply seeing it as a means to an end and nothing more.

Larceny was first announced with an average suggested price of $25 per 750 back in 2012. It’s stayed in that range from what I’ve observed, and you’ll see it float from the low $20’s up to about $30. This is generally higher than the Old Fitzgerald predecessor(s), but still a value play in today’s marketplace. While Larceny doesn’t offer a flavor profile that will wow anyone, I would argue it doesn’t turn off many either. Many competitors in the same price range are arguably more polarizing, offering more obvious character in contrast with Larceny’s balance and likeability. To that end, Larceny is an easy bourbon to recommend to anyone seeking a bourbon that errs on the sweeter side.","Larceny is an available, approachable, crowd-pleasing bourbon offered at a good price point.","It’s hard to believe Larceny was released almost seven years ago, as it seems like just yesterday when it came out. At the time, wheated bourbons like W.L. Weller and even Pappy Van Winkle were much easier, or less costly, to obtain than they are today. Since then, companies have dropped age statements in favor of flexibility, updated labels, and introduced successors and new brands aimed at the evolving bourbon consumer. Heaven Hill’s own Elijah Craig brand is one in particular that stands out, with the Small Batch version losing its 12 year age statement and remaining very close in price and proof to Larceny - the major difference being it contains rye within the mashbill versus Larceny’s wheat.

As Larceny remains essentially the same product it was when it was first released, it’s stood this short test of time and continues to be a bourbon I look upon favorably for what it offers. Since it has been around for a while, my thinking would be most seasoned bourbon drinkers have already formed an opinion on the brand. However, if it’s a bottle you’ve avoided or just haven’t had in a while, or if you’re just getting into bourbon, it’s worth exploring due to its price and likability.",Nick,2.5,3,2.5,2.5,3,2.5,https://www.breakingbourbon.com/review/larceny-bourbon
,Maker's Mark Bourbon,Classification: Straight Bourbon,Company: Beam Suntory,Distillery: Marker's Mark,Released: Ongoing,Proof: 90,Age: NAS,"Mashbill: 70% Corn, 16% Wheat, 14% Malted Barley",Color:  Toffee,MSRP: $30 (2017),Official Website,"Maker’s Mark is a wheated bourbon made in batches of less than 1,000 gallons (around 19 barrels at a time). It is a handcrafted bourbon that comes in a square-shaped container inspired by Bill Samuels Sr. wife’s collection of cognac bottles. Each bottle is dipped by hand as opposed to by machine. Incidentally, no two dippings are alike and sometimes a bottle is over-dipped which Maker’s Mark fondly refers to as a “slam dunk.”

Maker's Mark is one of the few distilleries to rotate the barrels from the upper to the lower levels of the aging warehouses during the aging process to even out the differences in temperature during the process. They are also one of the few American distilleries to use the Scottish spelling “Whisky” as opposed to the traditional American spelling “Whiskey.”","A big blast of sweetness immediately greets you with this one. Notes of vanilla, caramel, brown sugar and even a bit of strawberry are present. It’s a surprisingly strong scent for a 90 proof bourbon. Unfortunately, right out of the bottle it also gives off a strong ethanol smell that thankfully dissipates over time and further reveals its sweet core. It’s a very nice start that surprised me on how enjoyable it is.","Decidedly less sweet than the nose alludes to, but nevertheless still pleasant and unassuming. Notes of toffee, vanilla, and oak are most prevalent with fainter hints of toasted nut and cinnamon. Overall it has a thin but buttery mouthfeel that goes down smooth. Enjoyable but not mindblowing.","At first, the thinness of the bourbon makes the finish almost nonexistent, but then it comes bouncing back. I wouldn’t necessarily call the finish hot, but I wouldn’t call it meek either. The palate’s flavors that carry over to the finish are by no means deep and layered, but overall they’re pleasant and hard to find fault with.","At this point in the game, Maker’s Mark and bourbon have become synonymous with one another. Go to any bar in America and ask for a bourbon. If you don’t get Jim Beam, you’re getting Maker’s (also owned by Beam Suntory). A lot of this is due to Maker’s being the company’s sole product for 50+ years. It might be a stereotype, but anything that's extremely mainstream often isn’t also described as unique. This is one case where the whole is greater than the sum of its parts. The usual flavors suspects are all present here, but it’s the final product that tastes uniquely Marker’s. The combination of rotating aging barrels and a wheated mashbill with an above average amount of malted barley creates a very sweet palate that stands out from most bourbons on the market.

Of course the red wax dipped bottle is its most recognizable physical trait, and although many competitors are also using wax, Maker’s Mark holds a trademark on their wax drip, which is why they’re the only bourbon on the shelf with it. You don’t get to be where Maker’s is by throwing curveballs. Simply, it’s a down-the-middle bourbon and will appeal to just about anyone. It’s hard to truly hate it based on its taste, but it’s also not out of this world unique enough to truly love it either.","As with almost all bourbons, prices have gone up in the past few years and Maker’s Mark hasn’t been able to escape this. Once exclusively below $30, that is no longer the case. Larger liquor stores that buy it in bulk still price Maker’s at the “old price,” but those days are fading. As Maker’s approaches the $30 range, I begin to question its overall value. Often times Maker’s is used as a mixing bourbon, but this increase in price is, well...pricing the bourbon right out of that category. As a $30 sipping bourbon, the lack of depth on the palate also hurts it in this price range.

As it stands, Maker's is arguably priced right on the edge of fair and overpriced. If the price continues to rise, there are just too many great sub-$30 options to justify buying a bottle of Marker’s Mark. Considering the introduction of more premium bottlings including Maker's 46, Maker's Cask Strength, and Maker's 46 Cask Strength (arriving in late 2015), it seems Beam is diversifying the Maker's brand to keep it from appearing stale, a divergence from 50+ years of literally offering one single bottling. But what does this mean for the standard Maker's? With premium bottlings priced only moderately higher, the standard Maker's price appears even more out of balance.","Light on depth and sweet on flavor with a finish that comes bouncing back, Maker’s Mark is better than I remembered it. But as the price continues to slowly creep up, I wonder if it’ll still have a place on my shelf in a few years.","I stayed away from Maker’s Mark for quite some time. Some of that has to do with the fact that it is in every bar in America and it’s often described as “mainstream” doesn’t make it all that appealing to me. I became bored with the bourbon over the years. For many people, Maker's is where they began their bourbon journey. Years later, I wanted to feel like I had grown up from the days of the red wax bottle. One of the best aspects of the bourbon industry is its overall quality and value of the majority of the products it produces. Even the so-called big boys of the industry and their mass produced bourbon are often really great products. Maker's Mark is no exception.

That said, Maker's Mark never left much of an impression on me, but having it again, it's a lot better than I remembered it. It may not have an incredibly deep or unique palate, but it has some decent flavors that mingle well and finish with a nice burst. I might not be running to the store to buy as much as I can of it, but next time I see someone order one at a bar, I’ll try harder to be less of a bourbon snob and order one with them.",Eric,3,2.5,2.5,3,2.5,2.5,https://www.breakingbourbon.com/review/makers-mark-bourbon
,Maker's Mark Private Select Gift Shop Spring 2017,Classification: Bourbon,Company: Beam Suntory,Distillery: Maker's Mark,Released: Spring 2017,Proof: 112.5,Age: NAS (Around 6 years),"Mashbill: 70% Corn, 16% Wheat, 14% Malted Barley",Color:  Amber,MSRP: $80 (2017),Official Website,"Maker’s Mark Private Select line is a variation of Maker’s Mark Cask Strength. Whereas Maker’s 46 Cask Strength is created by using 10 Maker’s 46 finishing staves, Private Select creates unique flavor combinations by utilizing over 1,000 possible stave combinations. The distillery states each bottle of Private Select is “created by adding 10 custom finishing staves to each barrel and finishing them in our limestone cellar to extract more flavor.” These 10 finishing staves can be any combination of five different flavor profiles in the program. These include Baked American Pure 2, Seared French Cuvee, Maker’s 46, Roasted French Mocha, and Toasted French Spice.

For the Maker’s Mark Gift Shop Spring 2017 edition, 4 Baked American Pure 2 staves, 4 Seared French Cuvee staves, 1 Maker’s 46 stave, and 1 Toasted French Spice stave were used. This bottling was exclusively sold in the Maker’s Mark gift shop.","Surprisingly approachable even though it’s clocking in at over 110 proof. Toffee, rich vanilla, toasted oak, a dash of coffee, freshly baked hot cross buns, and the slightest hint of ethanol all waft up. It has just enough depth to differentiate itself from any other Maker’s nose I’ve experienced in the past, and provides for an enjoyable start to this bourbon.","It provides a surprising contrast from the sweetness that the nose delivers. An initial burst of sweet vanilla, corn, and light dried raisins is quickly replaced with spicy black pepper, wheat, and oak. These flavors are all encapsulated by the heat that was missing from the nose, as this bourbon starts to beat its chest and remind you that it is cask strength after all.","The heat carries through from the palate into a finish that is the driest part of the sip. Dry leather, old wood, and a hint of tobacco play out amongst the heat. The wood and tobacco quickly drop off leaving just dry tannic leather that is eventually joined with a fresh cut grass aftertaste. It’s a weird combination that lingers for a remarkably long time. Certainly not the note I was expecting to end on.","By default, nearly every Private Select bottling is going to be unique. With over a 1,000 combinations and various proof combinations, the uniqueness possibility is astounding. For example, Maker’s 46 Cask Strength was created from the inclusion of 10 Maker’s 46 staves. Change those 10 staves out for new types of oak staves, and you open up all sorts of flavor profiles for this line.

It’s clear that this Spring 2017 edition was born as a Maker’s Mark bourbon with many of the brand’s classic characteristics evident, however the finishing staves manage to alter the profile in a pretty impactful way. It’s really a neat concept by the somewhat conservative Maker’s that allows for flavor variation, while still remaining close to their core product.

The challenge with this line is that each bottle will be a gamble since every barrel dump will be unique due to the extreme finishing possibilities. This also acts as a double edged sword. Just because something is inherently unique, doesn’t mean that its quality will always match. This Spring 2017 edition is a clear example of this. The flavor profile doesn’t wow and it’s hard to tell why. Is it the specific combination of the staves, the proof it was bottled at, or the fact it may have started as just a mundane Maker’s Mark barrel? It’s hard to say, but it’s clear that uniqueness can lead to great results, as evidenced by the Maker’s Mark 46 Cask Strength bottle I reviewed.","Maker’s has decided to carry through its initial pricing of the 375ml bottles of Maker’s Mark 46 Cask Strength and sell this 750ml bottle for $80. This makes Private Select bottles the priciest non-limited edition Maker’s Mark bottles to date. There is certainly higher degree of handling due to the bespoke finishing of each barrel that accounts for the $80 price, but that price also doesn’t come with a guarantee. Once again the uniqueness factor and the somewhat randomness of stave selection comes into play here. If you have a favorite liquor store that you often like to buy store picks from, it’s probably a safer bet to try a Private Select bottling they’ve done. If you go in blind when purchasing a bottle, knowing the high degree of flavor variations with these releases, possibly more so than other single barrel finishes, it’s a true gamble with every bottle you buy.","It’s surprising to see Maker’s Mark select this bottling to highlight their Private Selection line for the Spring of 2017, but it goes to show not every stave combination is a home run.","I applaud Maker’s Mark for creating the concept of the Private Select line. While I don’t find the Spring 2017 bottling to be some of their finest work, it’s nice to see how different oak finishing staves impact the final outcome. That said, the high price tag combined with an unmemorable flavor profile has me scratching my head on how this made the selection to be highlighted in the gift shop. I’m sure some future barrels will be stellar just as much as I’m sure others will be a miss. That’s the nature of the Private Select line. Each bottle is a gamble, which can be both refreshing and also infuriating at the same time.",Jordan,3.5,2.5,2,4,2,2.5,https://www.breakingbourbon.com/review/makers-mark-private-select-gift-shop-spring-2017
,Mellow Corn Whiskey,Classification: Straight Corn Whiskey,Company: Heaven Hill,Distillery: Heaven Hill,Released: Ongoing,Proof: 100,Age: NAS,"Mashbill: 90% Corn, 10% Rye and Malted Barley",Color: Light Gold,MSRP: $12 (2017),Official Website,"Mellow Corn is a straight corn whiskey which has been aged in used Heaven Hill barrels. Unlike bourbon, which needs to have at least 51% corn in its mashbill and aged in new charred oak barrels, a corn whiskey must contain at least 80% corn in its mashbill and, if aged, can be aged in new uncharred or used oak barrels. Straight corn whiskey is corn whiskey that has been aged for 2 years or more.

According to Heaven Hill, Mellow Corn is the only extra-aged, Bottled in Bond (BiB) corn whiskey available. To be labelled BiB, the whiskey must be the product of one distillation season and one distiller at a single distillery, aged in a federally bonded warehouse under U.S. government supervision for at least four years, and it must be bottled at exactly 100 proof. Additionally, the BiB label must clearly identify the distillery where it was distilled and where it was bottled, if different.","A youthful corn-filled scent fully envelops my glass. Along with the corn, a healthy dose of vanilla, sweet plantains, and light oak are layered in. The slightest hint of ethanol is also present. The nose is far from impressive, and I would be shocked to think this is anything older than 2 years if I didn’t already know it to be 4 years old based on BiB label requirements.","Corn, rich vanilla, dried banana chips, toasted oak, and mixed nuts are all present and easy to pick out thanks to a light mouthfeel. As the name suggests it is quite mellow, which is likely a result of the high corn mashbill combined with being aged in used Heaven Hill barrels. Despite the 100 proof, it’s quite manageable, which allows me to roll this around my mouth for a while trying to pick out flavors. However come to find out it’s not really necessary, since the palate’s overall flavor profile errs on the simple side. That’s not necessarily a bad thing though, since its flavor profile, while mediocre, is still enjoyable.","This uncomplicated finish consists of vanilla and corn as the predominate flavors, followed only by the slightest hint of fruit juice. The finish contains a small amount of heat up front, but it’s the corn aftertaste that continues to dance in my mouth for quite a while after each sip.","Corn whiskey isn’t a new concept and neither is Mellow Corn. In fact, Mellow Corn has been around as a BiB corn whiskey since 1945, however it’s only been the last few years that people really started giving Mellow Corn notice.

Part of the recent attention is due to its low price point, but also due to the recent trend of well known craft distillers getting into the corn whiskey game. These include more well known names such as Tuthilltown Spirits with their Hudson Corn Whiskey, and Balcones with their Baby Blue Corn Whisky and True Blue Corn Whisky. While not everyone enjoys a high corn mashbill, I find it to be a nice break from so many traditional heavier rye and wheated whiskeys and bourbons on the market, and it’s nice to see younger distilleries pay tribute to this style of whiskey too.

Compared to Balcones True Blue Corn Whisky’s flavor profile, Mellow Corn’s is nowhere near as deep. Then again, True Blue Corn Whisky is barrel proof, bottled at 116.6 proof. Sure Mellow Corn’s flavor profile is a lot shallower by comparison, but it also sells for over four times less, and that right there is what makes Mellow Corn so unique. While many craft distillers are selling young corn whiskey for $45 or more, Mellow Corn is a decent tasting inexpensive BiB corn whiskey aged in used Heaven Hill barrels that won’t break the bank.","Most of the time when you’re paying around $12 for a whiskey, you expect that you’re going to get some bottom shelf swill - and normally you’d be right for thinking that. However, the great thing about Mellow Corn being labeled a BiB whiskey is that you’re guaranteed to be drinking at least a 4 year old 100 proof whiskey. Now this doesn’t mean it will be the best thing you ever tasted, but it does afford you a bit of hope that what you’ll try will be better than what you might normally expect for the price. And in this case, that’s exactly what you’re getting. For only $12, Mellow Corn delivers a different experience to whiskey drinkers, that while not the best, is certainly far from the worst.

Think about that for a second. For $12 you’re getting a unique whiskey that affords you an experience you normally wouldn’t have everyday thanks to its 90% corn mashbill, BiB designation, and aging in used Heaven Hill barrels. Compared to other corn whiskeys on the market, and even other bottom shelf whiskeys, it’s practically a steal for what you’re getting. For that price alone it’s worth picking up and trying a bottle just to see what you think.","Don’t let the old school label fool you, Mellow Corn offers an enjoyably unique drinking experience for an incredibly low price.","Corn whiskey won’t be for everyone, and that’s okay. For the price of a cocktail at a nice bourbon bar, you can buy a whole bottle of Mellow Corn, that at the very least can be used as a twist in any bourbon cocktails you make. The flavor profile may not be mind blowing, but it is just different enough from other American whiskeys and bourbons, to make you appreciate the fact that this has been a staple of the Heaven Hill family for the last 70+ years.",Jordan,2,2.5,2,3,3.5,2.5,https://www.breakingbourbon.com/review/mellow-corn-whiskey
In Depth Review,O.K.I. 10 Year Bourbon,Straight Bourbon,New Riff Distilling,Sourced from MGP,Ongoing,97.7,10 Years,"60% Corn, 36% Rye, 4% Malted Barley",Dark Copper,$46 (2018),,"Ken Lewis opened New Riff Distillery in the spring of 2014 in Newport, Kentucky, which is just on the other side of the river from Cincinnati. While New Riff builds up the supply of their own aged products, they sourced high-rye bourbon from MGP. They named this brand O.K.I. which stands for: Ohio, Kentucky, Indiana. Or as stated right on the bottle, distilled in Indiana, bottled in Kentucky, and loved in Ohio. O.K.I. was only made available in Kentucky and Ohio with limited distribution in Indiana. The brand consists of a number of age stated variants, single barrel store picks, and barrel aged varieties. Over the years the brand has built up a reputation of being transparent in regards to the products with a large amount of information printed on their labels. In staying transparent, New Riff stated that the O.K.I. brand will be discontinued in 2018 as they phase out sourced whiskey and transition to their own in-house distilled whiskey. 

","Not as in-your-face as some of the high rye bourbons that are distilled at MGP, however it’s still clear upon smelling this that O.K.I is an MGP bourbon. Upon bringing the glass to my nose I’m immediately greeted with rye spice and leather mixed with peaches. These are further mixed with light butterscotch, vanilla, coffee beans, whipping cream, and baked pie crust. The mixture of the rye spice with the prominent sweeter notes creates a pleasant combination.","A dose of rye spice is mixed with cinnamon, peaches, white pepper, and new oak along with a hint of summer berries. There is a subtle yet enjoyable heat to the palate. While the flavors are easy to pick out and enjoy, its lightness and lack of mouthfeel prevents it from truly taking off. Instead it’s just an average palate, no different from so many other MGP bourbons currently on the market.","In a word, lacking. It’s slightly dry with rye spice, oak, leather, and green pepper at the start. Those flavors quickly fade to just drier oak, which lasts a short amount of time before fading out.","Bravo to New Riff for the level of transparency they provide with their O.K.I. brand. The company is completely honest about the fact that while they age the barrels and select them when they feel ready, they don’t distill the mash that goes into this brand. In fact, they even incorporated this truth right into the name. In a bourbon world full of convoluted backstories and marketing gimmicks, it’s still nice to see transparency take center stage for some brands. Transparency aside, O.K.I. 10 Year doesn’t stand out from the rest of the crowd, MGP sourced or not. Its flavor profile is pleasant overall, but it just doesn’t deliver anything new or distinctive to the consumer. While there’s nothing wrong with being able to enjoy a bourbon in the moment, there’s something to be said to also aim to deliver a memorable experience too. In this sense, O.K.I. misses the mark.

","A few years ago, paying nearly $50 for a 10 year bourbon from MGP would have seemed too rich for my blood. Especially considering all the great age stated bourbons at the time such as Eagle Rare 10 Year Single Barrel, Elijah Craig 12 Year, Knob Creek Single Barrel 9 Year, and Henry McKenna 10 Year. However the market looks quite different than it did a few years ago. Eagle Rare lost its single barrel designation, and Elijah Craig and Knob Creek lost their age statements. Sure Henry McKenna 10 Year is still available and is a fantastic value, but that’s the exception to the norm nowadays.Today a 10 year age stated bourbon for under $50 seems like a rarity. While I would have liked a more mature flavor profile to be delivered for a bourbon aged 10 years, I also don’t regret spending the money I did to buy a bottle of O.K.I. 10 Year, especially considering it will no longer be in production soon. I would caveat to anyone who is considering buying this that there are certainly better bourbons out there for under $50, however if your game is age stated bourbons no matter the flavor profile, O.K.I. 10 Year surely delivers.

","O.K.I. 10 Year drinks much like its story, straightforward and without any frills.","The O.K.I. brand has been on my radar for a while, however it wasn’t until I had a few pours of various barrel finished varieties at Proof on Main in Louisville that I took interest in diving deeper for a full review. Unlike the barrel finished versions I tried, which were really intriguing and memorable, the standard 10 year bottling isn’t anywhere near as interesting. While its nose is inviting and gives me hope for things to come, the rest of the sip slowly goes downhill, ending on a weak finish that leaves much to be desired. It’s nice to see a 10 year age stated bourbon still selling for under $50, however in the end this bottling is nothing more or less than any other average bottle in the market.",Jordan,3,2.5,2,2.5,2.5,2.5,https://www.breakingbourbon.com/review/o-k-i-10-year-bourbon

Very light in color, this is the first bourbon whiskey offering from Michelone Reserve, a distillery that is more well known for their vodka products. Review bottle is from Batch 001","Picking up OYO for the first time, I was completely underwhelmed by what I smelled. Upon first (and second, and third, and fourth) whiff I was hit with a light alcohol scent mixed with rubber. If I was judging what bourbon to drink based on smell alone, I would pass on this every time.","The palate makes up for the nose. On the first taste, my mouth was hit with a super sweet wheat taste. The sugars from the wood really come out in OYO and it makes you wish that you were pairing it with ice-cream or fudge. Unfortunately, the thin palate disappears just as you’re starting to appreciate the sweet taste of this bourbon.","OYO has a really light, but long dry finish of new wood and leather. It lingered in my mouth for awhile as I debated what to make of this bourbon. On one hand, the nose does nothing for you, yet the palate is actually quite enjoyable that's followed by a finish which seems to be a ""take it or leave it type."" As I drank my glass, I went back and forth from liking the finish a lot to just finding it to be so-so.","I’m a fan of small distilleries, especially ones that are starting up in cities outside of Kentucky and Indiana. You get to see how grains and water from different parts of the country impact the final product. In this case, you also get to see how well a small distillery in Columbus, OH blends their wheated whiskey with a Kentucky straight bourbon.

Middle West Spirits has done a good job at producing this product. The blend of their whiskey made from Ohio’s soft red winter wheat with a Kentucky straight whiskey works well. They’ve delivered a very drinkable bourbon that most first-time bourbon drinkers can drink neat and enjoy.","Like most small distilleries this bourbon is priced higher than it’s worth. I realize that costs must be covered, but at $50 a bottle of bourbon should make me look forward to the next glass. Instead OYO has left me pondering how long it will take me to drink this bottle, as it just doesn’t jump out and beg me to drink more.

Ironically, after doing this review, I poured myself a second glass to pair with some fudge which worked quite nicely together. The sweet palate of the bourbon was enhanced by the super sweet chocolate fudge.  If it sold for $20 less, I’d recommend it as a bottle to have on hand to pair with desserts. At $50 a bottle it’s a hard sell.","In one word, ""fine."" Not good, not bad, just ""fine.""","Much like its palate and finish, this bourbon faded from my memory as soon as I was done drinking it. This is one bottle that I’d definitely recommend trying at your favorite bourbon establishment before deciding whether or not to spend the money to add it to your home bar.",Jordan,1,3.5,3,4,2,2.5,https://www.breakingbourbon.com/review/oyo-bourbon

Taking inspiration from Normandy Rye, a brand acquired by Brown-Forman in 1940, it’s made from an unusually high malt recipe of 65% rye, 20% malted barley, and 15% corn. According to Morris, the high percentage of malted barley “allows for a wholly natural fermentation process, leveraging Old Forester’s proprietary yeast strain.” It’s released at the same proof and price point as Old Forester Bourbon. Initially introduced in January, 2019 and nationwide in February, 2019, this will be an ongoing release.","Floral aromas upfront integrate with sweet brown sugar and a citrusy zest. The floral notes seem unusual for a rye, bringing a unique yet subtle twist to the category.","A light hint of bananas is followed by a mixture of spices - cloves, allspice, and a trace of nutmeg. Cocoa and a faint nuttiness round it out, providing a well balanced and integrated sip. It’s a tad light for the proofpoint, with less spice than I would have expected for a rye. Approachable and manageable, yet not quite as robust as the proof would suggest.","Initial peppercorn spice is overtaken by brown sugar sweetness, yielding a medium length finish that trends towards the sweeter side. Nothing about it is off-putting in any way, however it lacks the depth otherwise found on the nose and palate.","Such a high percentage of malted barley in a rye from a major distillery is unusual, as it typically ranges from about 4-12%. Generally speaking, malted barley’s primary purpose in bourbon and rye mashbills is to aid in the fermentations process, serving as the primary source of sugars necessary for fermentation.

Thinking of major distilleries, MGP Ingredients introduced a 51% rye, 49% malted barley mashbill in 2014, and while it’s likely made its way into a number of brands today, it is also likely blended with other mashbills and has not become commonplace as a standalone product. Last year Brown-Forman released Woodford Reserve Straight MaltWhiskey, which contains 51% malted barley. Other American whiskey distilleries experiment or even specialize in malt whiskey, sometimes using malt as much as 100% of the mashbill. While this is a growing category, it is still arguably uncommon. As evidence just look at your local retailer’s shelves - the percentage of American whiskey that would be classified as malt whiskey or even have an unusually high percentage of malt is relatively low.

It may seem like a tangent to be focusing on malted barley when analyzing a rye, however its high percentage plays an obvious role in the flavor profile of this rye. While many ryes are “just barely” rye at 51% rye along with a high percentage of corn, this rye is made from a 65% rye mashbill with 20% malted barley, and only 15% corn. What results is a rounder, softer flavor profile edging towards the characteristics that can be found in the growing American malt whiskey category. My guess is this is what contributes to the faint cocoa and nuttiness I noticed - flavors I rarely notice in rye whiskey. Overall this seemingly slight shift in mashbill away from the norm moves the needle just enough to yield a flavor profile that feels slightly new and different.","When completing the release date category in our classification section above, it is always refreshing to type “ongoing” for a new release. With a suggested price of $22.99, this lands squarely in today’s value category. Because it’s new and will reach different markets at different times, there might a brief perception of a swell in demand, however I believe Brown-Forman intends this to  always be readily available. Notably, their press release says, “it plays beautifully in cocktails,” and the additional marketing pamphlet that arrived with the bottle dedicated half of its space to cocktail recipes. Its price combined with its relatively robust 100 proof point and less than edgy flavor profile suggests cocktails are not just an afterthought, but more what this whiskey was primarily designed for. It drinks well on its own, and I think few will dislike it. To that end, it’s priced quite well and an easy recommendation as something to mix or sip casually, depending on your audience.","Old Forester impresses again with a new, quality, and soon-to-be readily accessible rye whiskey that costs just north of a 20 spot.","When describing this whiskey, it’s important to ensure I’m providing enough perspective. As I’m generally impressed with this rye for specific reasons, it is clearly a value whiskey ideal for cocktails and casual sipping. I can’t say that as a whole this is a whiskey that will impress a more die-hard enthusiast based on flavor profile alone. But die-hard enthusiasts aren’t the intended audience either, and it’s important to remember that this doesn’t cater to the same crowd in the same way as a one-off limited release might. I’m impressed with Brown-Forman for its relative quality to price point, along with approachability and slightly unique flair in an increasingly more crowded space.The sample used for this review was provided at no cost courtesy of Brown-Forman.

,Old Hickory Bourbon Black Label,Classification: Blended Bourbon,Company: R.S. Lipman Company,Distillery: Sourced from MGP,Released: Ongoing,Proof: 80,"Age: 89% 4 year or older whiskey, 11% 2-4 year whiskey","Mashbill: 90% Corn &  Rye, 10% Malted Barley",Color:  Light Gold,MSRP: $30 (2017),Official Website,"According to Chuck Cowdery, The Old Hickory was a Publicker brand based in Philadelphia. The company was one of the big “American liquor companies post-Prohibition.” The name 'Old Hickory' is a reference to Andrew Jackson, 17th president of the United States. Cowdery reports that the brand is estimated to have folded in 1981. R.S. Lipman Company acquired the brand in 2013.  R.S. Lipman Company is a distribution company in Tennessee. According to the company, the Lipman family has been buying and blending proprietary whiskeys since the repeal of prohibition. Old Hickory Whiskeys were sourced from the the Joseph E. Seagram’s facility in Lawrenceburg, IN. Both Old Hickory Black and White Labels are “custom blends made from selected made from Lipman-owned stocks of aged bourbon.” The mashbills were created in conjunction with longtime Seagram’s master blender, Pam Soule and contain 90% corn and rye. The whiskey is in limited distribution, but expanding, with additional expressions planned in the future.","Quite bright and chipper. A strong pop of crème brûlée that’s nicely mingled with notes of almond, and even slight hints of bubble gum. I would have liked the aromas to be a bit stronger mainly because of my enjoyment factor here. If you’re partial to crème brûlée, this nose is going to be hard to dislike since it plays such a prominent part of the flavor.","Minor notes of crème brûlée and almond from the nose continue into the palate, which are reinforced by slightly stronger notes of butterscotch and oak. The nose and palate work well blending complementary flavors together. Much like the nose, I would have liked a deeper, more prevalent breadth of flavors. As a result this whiskey is somewhat curbed by its thin palate. However, there is a chance that a stronger array of flavors might overpower the notable influence the nose contributes to this whiskey’s palate.","Medium length with the slightest of burns. Minor oak notes swell then mellow, which complements this whiskey’s palate well. No hint of youth on the finish despite containing 2 and 4 year old whiskeys. Faint hints of leather, toffee, and dried fruit on the backend, but not enough to make a lasting impact. There’s also a faint hint of custard on the tail end of the finish, but I wonder if it’s a lingering aroma influencing my tastebuds.","Crème brûlée is not unheard of as an element of a whiskey’s flavor profile. I just can’t think of any other whiskey that has it at such the forefront. It may turn some people off, but that could be said of any dominant flavor in a whiskey. In this case, I find it a refreshing departure and was certainly surprised by it. It is notable that this whiskey smells unlike any whiskey I’ve had before, and for many the custard aromas will probably be hard to dislike.","Before learning the price of this whiskey, I figured being a sourced whiskey from a company not widely known for their own brands, it would most likely command a higher-than-expected price. Few companies selling sourced whiskey are able to sell it at competitive prices against the big Kentucky distilleries. Priced at $30, Old Hickory Whiskey Black Label is within the realm of acceptability and in some ways can be applauded for its competitive pricing. It certainly has some stiff competition, both in comparative pricing and overall quality from the big distilleries’ brands, but at least it has a fair chance at this price.","An easy drinker thanks to an array of sweet and agreeable flavors, and a competitive price.","By far this whiskey’s standout trait is that it’s an incredibly easy drinker. The proof is a contributing factor, but it’s also the whiskey’s sweet custard-like nose, followed by a light palate and tame oak notes that steer it in this direction. It may not be for a whiskey connoisseur looking for a deep and developed palate, but more so for the connoisseur’s friends and family. At an affordable price, containing easy-to-like flavors and a low proofpoint, this whiskey can be perfect for certain occasions. Knowing those occasions and your audience will be key to getting the most out of this whiskey.

,Parker's Heritage Collection: 24 Year Bottled in Bond,Classification: Straight Bourbon,Company: Heaven Hill,Distillery: Old Heaven Hill Springs Distillery,Released: September 2016,Proof: 100,Age: 24 Years,"Mashbill: 78% Corn, 12% Malted Barley, 10% Rye",Color:  Warm Copper,MSRP: $250 (2016),Official Website,"This is the 10th yearly edition of the Parker’s Heritage Collection (PHC). This year’s release features two separate Bottled in Bond (BiB) vintages, one distilled in the Fall of 1990 and the other in the Spring of 1991 at Heaven Hill’s distillery in Bardstown, Kentucky (D.S.P. KY-31), which was destroyed in 1996 by fire along with seven rickhouses and over 90,000 aging barrels. As a result, this year’s bottling is sometimes referred to as “pre-fire.” At 24 years old, it is believed to be the oldest BiB bourbon released to date by any distillery. For every bottle sold, Heaven Hill will contribute $15 to ALS research and treatment in honor of the late Parker Beam who lost a six year battle with the disease in January 2017.

The bourbon in review is from the Spring 1991 batch.","Light intensity with woody components throughout. Off-smelling seasoned wood combines with allspice and a trace of ethanol to create a delicate spice. Inhaling with more intensity I get very light traces of burnt sawdust and freshly cut wood. The scents are intriguing, but don’t make for an overly welcome invitation to take a sip.","Seasoned wood comes first, leaning more towards rich than spicy. While it starts off dry, a torrent of heavy, aged oak brings a mouth-coating viscosity along with it. A hint of burnt s'mores sweetness mingles with black pepper and allspice towards the end. With the exception of the initial dryness, there’s a “soggy” flavor characteristic throughout, like funky, dank musty old wood, but it’s not as awful as it sounds. It makes for an interesting, albeit strange, experience.","Medium to long, it starts with some bitterness from the seasoned wood, but transitions to sweet with a bit of chocolate towards the end. Not surprisingly, soggy oak characteristics dominate at the start, but they find some balance against light cinnamon and black pepper spice, which are eventually overtaken by the sweetness. This combination succeeds at leaving a nice last impression.","I’ve always thought the more unique a bourbon tastes, the more polarizing it will be among drinkers. This is no exception. The Parker’s Heritage Collection is different every year, often pushing the envelope on concept and style. Close in age, the second edition of the Collection was a little older at 27 years, but it was more balanced, possibly due in part to its lower proofpoint and no doubt barrel selection.

This 24 year old 100 proof Bottled in Bond edition is, at its core, a unique example of how bourbon that’s aged well beyond the more common 4-12 year time frame can ultimately taste. Recent comparisons include the high-aged Orphan Barrels, Evan Williams 23 Year, and the annual Pappy Van Winkle 23 Year, which few will have the opportunity to taste. Probably most comparable and widely released is Heaven Hill’s own Elijah Craig 23 Year, and of course the other high aged bourbons in the series. While I’d describe my last taste of the Elijah Craig 23 Year as an oak bomb, Parker’s 10th goes a different route. With its characteristic “sogginess,” it’s as if the barrels aging Parker’s didn’t experience a tremendous amount of evaporation loss, but rather retained a good amount of moisture over the years. Maybe the barrels themselves were a bit more soggy as they aged, retaining more water than usual due to their specific location in the rickhouse. I’m just speculating about all of this, but given the resulting flavor profile, I can’t help but think there may have been a unique aging situation at play. In any event, this is a 100 proof 24 year old Bottled in Bond bourbon with a characteristically unusual flavor profile, leaving few comparables out there.","The value proposition with limited releases is a tricky one, as lack of continuous supply ultimately means scarcity will become reality sooner or later. The concept of scarcity has become a carefully manufactured marketing tool for some of the companies behind today’s releases, but marketing is not always to blame. While I’m certainly not privy to Heaven Hill’s bourbon stocks, the idea that this particular release is truly limited and they’re running low on quality high aged stock doesn’t seem far fetched.

The Parker’s Heritage Collection has generally been met with mixed feelings, and as a result, seems more attainable at MSRP than other high profile limited releases. The 10th edition is no exception. At $250 out of the gate, it’s no bargain but certainly not outlandish by today’s standards considering it’s age, unique flavor profile, “pre-fire” status, and most notably what consumers seem to be willing to pay for the exclusivity they’ll enjoy in owning a bottle.

But taste matters. An impressive whiskey on paper, there’s more value here in the form of a collector’s item than as a bourbon with a must-have flavor profile. While I’m always one for opening and sharing, I can’t get behind the price tag for any reason other than to own a piece of history. If you think you might really enjoy this release, you’ll be better served trying before buying at this price point or at its even higher going rate on the secondary market. Considering its $250 MSRP as a starting point, even trying is going to cost you, so be prepared to pay in order to satisfy your curiosity.","A relic of a distillery that once was, Parker’s Heritage 10th edition is a unique example of how polarizing the flavor profile of a bourbon aged over two decades can be.","I give Heaven Hill a lot of credit for pushing the envelope with their Parker’s Heritage Collection limited releases. Producing a high number of Bottled in Bond whiskeys as a whole within the industry, it’s not surprising they eventually chose to release the oldest one to date. While the resulting flavor profile offers many things, mass appeal is not one of them. Maybe it’s partly due to lack of experience with and varied opinions of what we think a really old bourbon “should” or “might” taste like, the fact is I’m not surprised how polarizing this release has been among consumers. I find myself a bit ambivalent towards it, and as a result can appreciate how someone may either love or hate this release. That said, I hope Heaven Hill continues to push the envelope with their Parker’s releases each year. I’d encourage enthusiasts who didn’t find much to love with this version to keep the idea in mind that pushing the envelope, even if the end product isn’t to your liking, can ultimately be a positive thing. I’m certainly looking forward to the next edition, whatever it might be.

,Peerless Straight Rye Whiskey 2 Year,Classification: Straight Rye,Company: Kentucky Peerless Distilling Company,Distillery: Kentucky Peerless Distilling Company,Released: Spring 2017,Proof: 108,Age: 2 Years,Mashbill: Undisclosed,Color:  Light Copper,MSRP: $125 (2017),Official Website,"Peerless is a storied brand that dates back to the 1880’s when it was first barreled and sold by E.W. Worsham & Co. Operations based in Henderson, Kentucky. Like so many other distilleries during the time, the distillery and the Peerless brand became a victim of Prohibition. In 2014, the Peerless brand was reborn as Corky and Carson Taylor refurbished a building in downtown Louisville and obtained the original Kentucky Distilled Spirits Plant Number (DSP-KY-50) from the original Peerless Distillery in the 1800’s. In March of 2015 they barreled their first rye.

Two years later they’re releasing their first 2 year old small batch straight rye whiskey. Each bottle represents micro batching, with only six barrels blended to produce each batch. Additionally, the Taylors have chosen to use a sweet mash between each fermentation, which is a differentiation from the typical sour mash used by most distillers.","The nose smells youthful but still flavorful. Fresh oak, banana, and corn lead the way. Behind this are slight hints of vanilla, rye, pine, and anise. These are mixed with an ever present hint of ethanol throughout. Overall the nose isn’t a standout, yet it’s still a pleasant introduction.","Sweet and spicy flavors all wrapped into one. The rye initially hits your lips with a sweeter flavor profile before exploding into a spicy blast as it envelops your mouth. Brown sugar and vanilla are followed by a mixture of rye spice, oak, pepper, and a touch of peaches. Heat is a constant factor throughout the palate, however it isn’t overbearing and if anything, it helps to enhance the flavors and even slightly hides the rye’s youthfulness. Surprisingly it doesn’t taste like a rye that’s only been in the barrel for 24 months, however it also doesn’t punch much above that age range either.","Corn and oak lead the way followed by dabs of leather, rye grain, and vanilla. The finish is slightly dry and ever so tannic. Lingering hints of new oak and dashes of smoke stay present long after the sip ends.","Peerless tries to distinguish itself from its peers through the use of a new sweet mash with every batch, low barrel entry proof (107 proof), small batching (only 6 barrels at a time), and by using barrels from smaller cooperages. They also use a high-end looking bottle, which convey a classic yet fresh look. While all these traits are unique in relation to their competition, Peerless fails to differentiate itself on the part that counts, its flavor profile.

The whiskey shows a good deal of promise, yet it still tastes like a relatively young, high proof rye when it comes down to it. It has just enough new oak taste to remind you that it’s young, with just enough complexity to show you that it may turn into something great in the future. In the meantime, you’re left with a perfectly fine rye to sip and wonder “just how did they do it?” but in the end it just doesn’t really stand out from many other ryes on the market.","Peerless is a newly revived distillery out of Kentucky selling their young distillate. If this story sounds familiar, it should. Just a few short years ago this exact same headline could have applied to Willett as they released their own 2 year aged distillate. The differences though end right there. Not even taking into account Willett’s unique flavor profile, what’s incredibly different is the fact that Willett priced their rye under $40 versus the $100+ price tag that Peerless chose.

The fact of the matter is, Peerless Rye does not live up to its price tag. $100+ for a 2 year rye is absurd unless it’s one of the best ryes on the market. Yes this rye shows potential, but pricing on potential isn’t enough, even in today’s marketplace. If you’re going to spend over a $100 on a rye, I would be remiss if I didn’t suggest to spend a few dollars more for Kentucky Owl Rye, which is similar in proof and aged an extra 9 years. If you can’t find an Owl or don’t want to pay $100 or more but are still looking for a high proof rye, Pikesville 6 Year Rye is another good bet. Yes they’re different flavor profiles, but both deliver a much better drinking experience than Peerless does.",Peerless Rye delivers a youthful yet promising flavor profile that’s being sold at an unjustifiable price point.,"I give Peerless credit, they’re trying to start from scratch and it’s clear they take pride in their work. From the fact that they use a sweet mash for all distillations to the fact that they use beautiful packaging, this is a company that is pulling out all the stops. However this all comes at a high price to the consumer. It’s admirable that they want to build and expand, but charging the consumer up front to fund all of this is not the best way to go about it.

That said, at 24 months, Peerless Rye shows promise, and in some respects, it’s actually quite impressive what they’ve managed to create with only 24 months of aging. I’m genuinely enthused to see how this rye ages over the next couple of years. With more time in oak is has the potential to be an above-average rye even. The fact of the matter is, that it’s just not quite there yet. Sure it’s respectable in its current form, however it’s impossible not to take into account its price before pulling the trigger on this rye. It’s unfortunate, because more attention should be put on what Peerless is creating and not what they’re charging.

,Pinhook Bourbon N Rye,Classification: Straight Rye,Company: CJS Beverage Corp.,"Distillery: MGP Ingredients, Inc.",Released: Fall 2017,Proof: 93.5,Age:  NAS (aged at least 24 months),"Mashbill: 95% Rye, 5% Malted Barley",Color: Golden Hay,MSRP: $38 (2018),Official Website,"Bourbon N Rye is the 8th release by Pinhook, and the first straight rye whiskey bottled under the brand’s name. Stated on their website to have “over 24 months of barrel age on it,” the rye is sourced from MGP and blended by Sean Josephs at the Castle & Key Distillery in Millvile, KY. In 2017, Castle & Key began distilling rye for Pinhook which will allow the company to be able to fine-tune the flavor profile to their liking.

Through a partnership with Bourbon Lane Stable LLC, each lot of Pinhook showcases an individual thoroughbred. For the first rye release, Bourbon N Rye was chosen, which is a Dark Bay / Br. Gelding that was bred in Kentucky. In addition to the horse, each edition of Pinhook Rye will be distinguished by a different wax color.","A familiar MPG rye scent is present but with a twist. Light rye spice is immediately noticeable but not the main focus. Additional notes of summer fruits are mixed in with lighter notes of hay, brown sugar, cherry, and a tad of cinnamon apple. While the scents are lighter, it’s surprising how much they pull you in for a two year old rye. Quite enjoyable.","Bourbon N Rye has a sweet, slightly oily mouthfeel full of fruit flavors, orange and citrus being the most prominent. The sip also presents new oak, a tad of rye spice, vanilla, and white pepper. For a 95% rye, it’s sweeter than expected.","The finish is quite the opposite of the nose and palate. Gone are the sweet flavors of fruits, and instead is dry from start to finish starting with faint vanilla, heavy leather and oak/rye spice. Additional notes of light tobacco and nuts are present. For such a young rye, it’s surprising how dry and woody this is. Overall the finish is pretty short and fades pretty quickly.","Sourced MGP rye isn’t anything groundbreaking. It’s usually pretty consistent and delivers a decent sip. What’s surprising for Pinhook’s first foray into rye is that they were able to pull out a sweeter flavor profile in their blend. Normally this would be considered a downfall seeing as the sweetness masks the young age of this rye, but here it’s actually a plus. If you prefer older ryes this probably won’t hold a candlestick to them for you, but it would do excellent against other two year variants.

Additionally, this is a fruity rye in a similar vein to Rittenhouse Rye. While a fruity non-traditional rye profile is normally not what I’m looking for when pouring a rye, I can see how this would be a positive for some. For those who are looking to dip their toes into the world of ryes, this is a nice transition. You’ll start to be exposed to slight rye spice while also sticking with a sweeter profile that may be attractive to some.","Considering that Bourbon N Rye is a sourced, albeit young rye, its nearly $40 price is right at what you would expect it to be. It’s in the range that Willett initially priced their two year rye when it first came out. Granted Willett made their rye in-house versus sourcing it, but with rising prices all around, it’s about as near apples to apples as you can get. One won’t feel they got ripped off paying its asking price, but they also won’t be getting a hidden gem in terms of price to flavor profile either.",Bourbon N Rye’s youthful age and fruit forward flavor profile deliver a surprisingly easy-to-drink everyday sipper.,"Bourbon N Rye is a nice first entry into the rye market for the Pinhook brand. The fruity rye flavor profile while not overly complex, makes for one easy sipping whiskey. It won’t blow anyone away, but it will please most who have a pour.It will be interesting to see the final flavor profile Pinhook’s ryes take on over time, as the brand moves to using their own distillate being produced at Castle & Key. Will the flavor profile continue to contain these distinctive characteristics or will they decide to move forward with a spicier flavor profile? Only time will tell, however in the meantime, Bourbon N Rye is a good first rye whiskey showing for Pinhook.",Jordan,3,2.5,2,3,2.5,2.5,https://www.breakingbourbon.com/review/pinhook-bourbon-n-rye
In Depth Review,Pinhook Rye'd On,Straight Rye,CJS Beverage Corp. ,Castle & Key,March 2020,97,Aged more than 2 years (Press release states it's 3 years old),"60% Rye, 20% Corn, 20% Malted Barley",Straw,$38 (2020),,"In the past, Pinhook has sourced their whiskey from MGP, but Rye’d On marks a drastic change for the company. For the last few years they have been contract distilling and aging a proprietary rye mashbill with Castle & Key Distillery. Rye’d On was distilled and aged at Castle & Key and was blended and proofed by Sean Josephs, Pinhook’s co-founder and master taster. Rye’d On is the first whiskey to come out of the resurrected Old Taylor Distillery since it was abandoned in 1972. Through a partnership with Bourbon Lane Stable LLC, each lot of Pinhook whiskey showcases an individual thoroughbred. According to Pinhook, Rye’d On was purchased at the OBS June Sale for $70,000 after running an eighth of a mile in 10.0 seconds. His sire is Competitive Edge, and he is out of the Halo’s Image mare named Crystal Image, a winner herself and he is a half brother to Crystal Rosario, a stakes placed filly.

","Delicate scents of hay, cinnamon, and peach form an aroma that is pleasing yet a bit understated. Hints of oak are present and work well with the other scents. The aroma is inviting, but lacks a certain amount of satisfying richness.","A slightly creamy and delicate delivery of cinnamon, mint, peach, and apricot. It’s inoffensive in almost every sense, as the flavors are well balanced and are presented in a gentle way. This is an enjoyable, easy-sipping rye through and through that puts drinkability above all else.","The heat and intensity ramps up during the finish and accents its peach notes well. A mild dry aftertaste lingers on the back of its more prominent oak and cinnamon notes. It’s not overly complex, but leans much more on classic rye characteristics than at any other part of its flavor profile.","As one of the first rye whiskeys on the market produced from the newly resurrected Castle & Key Distillery, many will be curious if American whiskey has a new major player in the realm of contract distilling. With recent notable showings from New Riff, Peerless, and Wilderness Trail, the next generation of distilleries in Kentucky is heating up. Up until this point Pinhook has sourced the majority of their whiskey from MGP. While MGP has made great whiskey for many years, they appear to have over-extended themselves lately, as so much whiskey is now on the young side and comes with less of a quality guarantee than it once did. Pinhook finds itself in a great place, having partnered with Castle & Key right from their re-opening. The company worked with them to formulate the mashbill and these barrels have been distilled and aged at Castle & Key, waiting until Pinhook felt they were ready for release. This of course will result in attracting the extra attention that comes with showcasing the company’s first distillate. There is a chance this could also not work out in their favor, as there is no guarantee that Castle & Key’s distillate is going to immediately hit a home run out of the gate.
Rye’d On is fascinating for what it is. For a rye that’s aged around 2-3 years old, it isn’t what you’d expect it to be. It doesn't taste overly grainy, it doesn’t lean heavily on a classic rye flavor profile, and its flavor profile also doesn’t come at you from left field. It’s surprisingly gentle in its delivery, features a welcomed creaminess, and most importantly, features a flavor profile that is unique but not peculiar either. Thankfully this is not yet another boring rye on the market and works to offer something special in a tasteful way.

","There has been a welcomed trend among newcomer brands to move away from the bloated pricing we saw from them for years. With Pinhook being a new company, relatively speaking, and Castle & Key in their infancy, it's quite surprising that Rye’d On is priced at only $38. American whiskey drinkers have been trained to expect the worst when it comes to pricing from young companies, yet, Rye’d On meets consumer expectations of what a young whiskey should be priced at. It might not be as aggressively priced as a newcomer like Wheel Horse Rye at $28, but Pinhook also doesn’t have to be. They have done well to establish themselves, and pricing Rye’d On at $38 is not only perfectly reading the room, it's just aggressive enough to make you want to give it a chance.",Pinhook’s first rye from the newly-minted Castle & Key Distillery is a fascinating one with its gentle delivery of well-balanced flavors at a respectable price.,"Contract distilling whiskey from an unproven distillery can be a risky proposition. There are far more examples of failed young whiskeys than there are of success stories. You can’t fault Pinhook for jumping at the opportunity to work directly with Castle & Key to formulate this whiskey. This partnership seems to be off to an advantageous start for both parties, as Rye’d On forgoes a lot of the common faults of young rye whiskeys from new distilleries. It’s not grain-forward, it is not overly spicy, and its flavor profile doesn’t lean too far in the bizarre direction either. Rye’d On drinks easy with flavors that work well togethers and is an all-around nicely balanced whiskey. It could use more oak and complexity in its flavor profile, but as an early example of Pinhook and Castle & Key’s distilling prowess, it performs admirably.",Eric,2.5,3,2.5,3,2.5,2.5,https://www.breakingbourbon.com/review/pinhook-ryed-on

As Zamanian notes, “She pulled me down a rabbit hole I might never have dared alone, to the countryside of Kentucky, the progressive vibrancy of Louisville, and, inevitably, to Bourbon.”

In 2019, Pernod Ricard acquired a majority stake in Rabbit Hole with the intent to utilize Pernod Ricard’s distribution network, but maintain Rabbit Hole’s downtown Louisville-based location.

Soon after joining forces with Pernod Ricard, Rabbit Hole launched Heigold, and rebranded its core whiskeys with the intent of honoring Louisville figures along with the life of Zamanian. According to Rabbit Hole’s website, “[Heigold] pays tribute to an immigrant maker. Strong and bold, this offering honors Christian Heigold, a German stonecutter who settled in Louisville prior to 1850. Taken by the hope of this new land, he carved symbols of his patriotism on the facade of his now landmark home.”

While Rabbit Hole has maintained control over its mashbills and distilling process from its inception via contract distilling at an undisclosed Kentucky distillery, they began distilling onsite at their downtown Louisville location in 2018. As a result, the bourbon inside currently-available bottles of Heigold has been distilled at an undisclosed distillery in Kentucky. It’s expected that distillate originating from their Louisville distillery will make its way into bottles replacing that distilled elsewhere in the next year or so as it comes of age.","Caramel and gingerbread sweetness gently rise from the glass. A quick swirl reveals apricot and a touch of oak, adding a layer of dimension. It’s medium to light in overall intensity, and offers a pleasant and inviting introduction to the sip.","Sweet brown sugar and caramel contrast rye spice and burnt oak. The overall impression is characteristically sweet. The delivery is surprisingly gentle considering the proof, and the bourbon is relatively thin. Despite this, it’s an enjoyable combination of flavors few will find fault with.","A crescendo of rye spice briefly surges in the finish, with sweet flavors of vanilla, caramel, and gingerbread rushing back quickly. Medium-length, it ends on a sweet note which is consistent considering the rest of the sip.","On first glance Rabbit Hole’s sexy whiskey bottle with its modern design and elegant curves seems as if it may be just another marketing play - boring whiskey in a high end bottle. But a closer look reveals more than meets the eye: It’s 70% corn, 25% rye, 5% malted barley mashbill, a 3 year age statement, and information revealing it was aged in barrels from Kelvin Cooperage. While this inclusion of details may go unnoticed by most, it’s welcomed information for those seeking a little more background. Beyond the label, Rabbit Hole’s website reveals Heigold entered the barrel at 110 proof, much lower than the more typical (and maximum allowed by law) 125 proof, and was aged in char #3 barrels.

While only three years old, you would never guess it based on Heigold’s taste alone. It’s also characteristically sweet, maybe to a fault. Further, its 95 proof is not exceptionally high, however it drinks lower. This sweet, developed, and easy-sipping experience is sure to appeal to many. However, there are plenty of sweet, easy-drinking bourbons to choose from, making Rabbit Hole’s Heigold less of a standout than its packaging might suggest.","Founded in 2012, and now majority owned by spirits giant Pernod Ricard, Rabbit Hole is arguably beyond the initial “craft distillery” startup phase. Heigold is, however, priced at a premium $70 consistent with craft whiskeys seeking to fund their pricey startups.

Unlike many craft whiskeys however, there is little to dislike about Heigold. It’s sweet, approachable, and offers a good amount of flavor even if it drinks lower than its 95 proofpoint. Its $70 price point is undoubtedly a market positioning strategy, and considering its high end packaging design I don’t doubt it will fetch it in today’s market. However, considering other sweet-forward low-priced bourbons like Evan Williams Bottled in Bond, Larceny, and Maker’s Mark, to name a few, it’s hard to justify a $70 price tag for Heigold.","Rabbit Hole Heigold is a characteristically sweet, easy-drinking bourbon that’s hard to find anything to dislike about it except for its price.","I spent three days getting to know Rabbit Hole Heigold, and it grew on me during that time. It is shockingly developed for being only three years old, similar to the developed flavor I noticed with the two year old Breckenridge Bourbon. However, its $70 price tag is a hard pill to swallow, considering similar bourbons you can find for a much lower price tag. As time progresses, I would assume Rabbit Hole intends to surpass the four year mark and then some as most Kentucky bourbon makers strive for, further developing Heigold to add layers of dimension to what is already a tasty bourbon. Further, while they controlled the various aspects of distillation, this particular batch was not distilled at Rabbit Hole’s downtown Louisville distillery, which started up distillation in 2018. As a result, I’m excited to see how the product changes once that’s brought into the mix. Until then, for those seeking a sweet bourbon and who are willing to shell out a little extra coin, it certainly won’t disappoint.",Nick,3,3,2.5,2.5,2,2.5,https://www.breakingbourbon.com/review/rabbit-hole-heigold-bourbon
,Rebel Yell 100 Bourbon,Classification: Straight Bourbon,Company: Lux Row Distillers,Distillery: Undisclosed Kentucky Distillery(ies),Release Date: April 2019 (Ongoing),Proof: 100,Age: NAS,"Mashbill: Undisclosed (Includes corn, wheat, and malted barley)",Color: Golden Hay,MSRP: $20 (2019),Official Website,"Introduced in April 2019, Rebel Yell 100 is a wheated bourbon, and a new bottle extension for the Rebel Yell brand. Rebel Yell 100 was launched in conjunction with a rebranding of the entire Rebel Yell family. Lux Row Distillers states that the new bottle features an embossed rounded shoulder in addition to revised front and back labels. The new bottle is also topped with a matted capsule closure and a natural cork.","The nose is quite approachable due to how light it is for a 100 proof bourbon. It doesn’t have much depth and is straightforward with hints of hay and corn up front, and light scents of oak, caramel, and ethanol that linger behind. While the scents aren’t bad in nature, it’s certainly disappointing how little overall depth this nose delivers for a 100 proof bourbon.","The sip’s oily mouthfeel is immediately noticeable and is slightly sweet overall. While notes of oak, vanilla, light leather, wheat grain, corn oil, and white pepper are all present, they’re largely straightforward. The palate is hard to fall in love with, but also hard to find fault with it either.","The finish starts with oak, corn, leather, and sweet vanilla. It’s medium in length, with layered heat, pepper, and oak on the backend. The finish encapsulates what this bourbon represents; straightforward, to the point, and one that isn’t bad, but won’t leave a lasting impression once you finish off your glass.","It’s pure coincidence that Rebel Yell 100 also happens to be my 100th long form bourbon review. When I realized this fact, I pondered on it for a bit and realized that it ended up being suiting that it turned out this way. With all of the various bourbons we try here at Breaking Bourbon, sometimes it’s easy to forget that some bourbons just blend in and don’t stand out from the crowd.

Not all bourbons deliver a memorable drinking experience, nor are they ones that you’d readily reach for on your shelf. Rebel Yell 100 is one of those bourbons. It delivers an overall average sip, but fades from memory the moment your glass is done. In terms of unique factors, you won’t find any here.","While the Rebel Yell 100’s flavor profile won’t wow anyone, its price certainly won’t offend anyone either. For $20, you get a straightforward, sippable bourbon that you can just as easily serve neat as you can with it mixed with Coke or ginger ale. With today’s ever increasing prices, it’s rare for a bourbon to have a price that promotes experimentation, without feeling like you’re wasting money.","A straightforward bourbon that won’t wow you, but won’t break the bank either.","Rebel Yell 100 most likely won’t impress anyone, but maybe it doesn’t need to. Not every bourbon needs to stand out, as long as it can still deliver an adequate sip for a fair price. Rebel Yell 100 fulfills that definition well. It’s an affordable bourbon that delivers a good enough flavor profile to drink neat, but also thanks to its $20 price tag, encourages you to experiment making cocktails with it as well.

,Rhetoric Bourbon 20 Year,Classification: Straight Bourbon,Company: Diageo/Orphan Barrel Whiskey,Distillery: Bernheim,Released: June 2014,Proof: 90,Age: 20 Years,"Mashbill: 86% Corn, 8% Malted Barley, 6% Rye",Color:  Deep Copper,MSRP: $85,Official Website,"Review bottle number: 18501. From the official website: “An ever-changing specimen, Rhetoric is an experiment in how barrel maturation imparts a lasting impression year after year. Each new year results in an older and wiser limited release from remaining maturing stock.”","Smoke, leather and oak are the easiest notes to pull out. Underneath, there’s a simmer of cinnamon, caramel, apple cider and toasted nuts.  Much like Barterhouse, this has a wonderfully developed and interesting nose.","Lots of oak and some notes of rye. Minor hints of dried fruit, like cherries and apples and tiny (and I mean tiny) amount of chocolate can be tasted.","This medium length finish packs a flavor punch in its first half, followed by a very dry finish that lingers far too long. It tastes higher proof than it is, much more so than the other Orphan Barrel releases. Again, minor notes of rye and bitter chocolate can be tasted.","You simply don’t see a lot of high aged bourbons anymore. So when you do, they’re always so fascinating. From what many master distillers say, it’s a pretty fine line between developing a well aged bourbon with nuanced flavors and a bourbon that's over aged and over oaked. When a new high aged bourbon hits the market, tasting it is always an interesting experience.

First off,  Rhetoric doesn’t taste as “watered down” as Barterhouse did. Any positive flavor notes Barterhouse had were undone by its low proof point. Rhetoric on the other hand has a more intense oak kick and a dry finish that stays with you. If aging is done right and the oak is balanced with the other flavor notes, you can have a winner on your hands (e.g. Parker’s 27 year, Sazerac 18, Pappy 20, Van Winkle Rye). Unfortunately, this is not the case with Rhetoric. It borders on too much oak that causes the finish to be much too dry and drum out any other flavors it may have had.","Released at a $10 premium over Barterhouse, both of these 20 year old bourbons don’t quite satisfy as much as their price warrants. I’ll ask myself again what I asked  in my Barterhouse review: Did I feel I paid too much for it? Yes. Did I feel ripped off? In this case, Yes. Chasing old American whiskey has become an addiction for many. Master distillers time and time again state that bourbon reaches its “sweet spot” around 9-10 years, yet consumers can’t help themselves chasing that high age statement. Comparable to other high aged bourbons on the market, Rhetoric is priced lower than most, but the quality just isn't there. Truthfully, any one of the bourbons in our “Best $20-$40 Bourbons” series of articles is a better buy than this.",Oak overpowers other flavors and leaves an overly dry aftertaste.,"Right now in the bourbon marketplace we just don’t see many hyper aged bourbons. The issue with Rhetoric is that the oak overpowers the entire experience, and although it doesn’t completely ruin it, it keeps it from being something truly great. If Diageo continue with their plan to keep aging this and releasing a year older version for the next 5 years, I just don’t see how this is going to get any better. If you have a taste for heavy oak bourbon, give Rhetoric a shot, otherwise this is a pass.",Eric,4.5,2,2,2.5,3,2.5,https://www.breakingbourbon.com/review/rhetoric-bourbon-20-year
,Roaming Man Straight Rye Cask Strength,Classification: Straight Rye,Company: Sugarlands Distilling Company,Distillery: Sugarlands Distilling Company,Released: July 2017,Proof: 123.4 (Cask Strength),Age: 2 Years,"Mashbill: 51% Rye, 45% Corn, 4% Malted Barley",Color: Dark Honey,MSRP: $50 (375ml) (2017),Official Website,"Sugarlands Distilling Company was founded in 2014 and is located in Gatlinburg, Tennessee. The company produces moonshine, Sippin’ Cream, and now aged whiskey. This is the second release of Roaming Man whiskey.

According to Ashley McCloud, Sugarlands’ Public Relations Coordinator, “Roaming Man embodies the spirit of exploration and tradition. Staying true to that spirit, we look forward to developing compelling mashbills as well as honoring the heritage of traditional whiskey distilling. These first small batches will be similar, but we intend to add to the lineup as we introduce other types of whiskey and experiment with mashbills and styles.” Ashley adds, “ In April we hit our 2-year aging mark. We will continue to release from our original barrels but we are also laying more barrels down with the intention of aging them for different lengths of time.”

Sugarlands Distilling Company provides a wealth of information on the bottle’s label which includes: Type, mashbill, barrel type, distillation date, age at bottling, barrel date, stave aging time and method, barrel char level, filtration method, barrel size, still/barrel entry proof, evaporation rate, batch number, and bottle number (see photograph below for full details). In addition to the information provided on the label, a separate gas chromatograph is provided with each bottle that details the “DNA” compounds of the whiskey, showing its makeup both before and after barrel aging.

For this release, a total of three 25 gallon barrels were dumped.","Alcohol heavy at first, giving the whiskey some additional air time allows the alcohol to die off, revealing powerful and inviting scents. Raisin is most prominent, with dark fruit and vanilla mingling in. There’s an undertone of young whiskey aroma present, which at 2 years old is to be expected. Fortunately, the other more inviting scents gently overpower it.","Rye spice pops immediately, and dominates the sip heavy-handedly. It has a nice oily mouthfeel, coating the tongue thoroughly but still revealing little beyond the spice at this point. There’s a bit of that young whiskey taste present as well, but to be fair, less than I expected for its age.","The finish is where this whiskey really comes to life. The rye spice pops again, but its potency tapers off quickly giving way to whole new set of flavors and a fair amount of depth. Hinted on the nose, sweet raisins pull in against the tapering spice. There’s also a touch of oak, some vanilla, and a hint of apple bringing balance and evidence of age to the flavor profile. The finish is long-lasting, with the flavors working in harmony with one another making it a sip you want to come back to.","Roaming Man hits a number of marks you don’t always see with craft whiskey. It’s released at cask strength. The company offers a wealth of information and transparency right on the label and within the box it’s packaged in. Most importantly, it tastes good at the 2 year mark.

With so many whiskeys flooding the market, lines become blurred by brands and marketing, making it hard to distinguish one from another. Many tend to be sourced whiskeys, and some are even aged using “rapid aging” techniques like TerrePURE. Craft whiskeys distilled by the company producing them are not necessarily uncommon either, as seen by the growing number of upstart distillers in America. What is uncommon is for a craft distillery to produce a quality aged spirit within the first few bottlings, and that is a feat to be proud of. Sugarlands has accomplished that here, and I’m excited for what else they have in store.","At $50 for a 375ml, it’s certainly not cheap. But the value discussion goes a little deeper with this release because the purchase price gets you more than just a bottle, adding in an experience and unusual amount of detail about the whiskey to go with it.

This is the second batch of Roaming Man, and there were only 250 bottles released. It was offered online via pre-sale, and sold out within 48 hours. Purchasers are required to pick up their bottles from Sugarlands’ Gatlinburg distillery. Upon picking up, they also receive a private, behind the scenes tour of the Sugarlands’ Still House and Barrel House, a tasting of Roaming Man with a manager, and a presentation on the different flavors and aspects of Sugarlands’ whiskey.

Releasing this rye at cask strength was a smart move, but also a risky one. It’s something I feel like I don’t come across too often with craft whiskeys. At such a high proof, the ethanol can overpower the experience, especially for younger, rougher, less developed whiskeys. Fortunately in this case, the higher proof allows the flavors to shine and brings with it a more satisfying experience. If you prefer a lower proof all you need to do is add some water and you’ll not only get the proof where you like it, you’ll multiply the volume of whiskey to sip beyond its 375ml packaging.

While this whiskey is not a $100/750ml quality whiskey by comparison to many of Kentucky’s majors, the good news is being bottled in the smaller 375ml volume means you only need to shell out $50 to claim rights to a bottle of your own. Considering the impressive development of flavor for its young age, the limited nature of the release, the experience provided with purchase, and the overall transparency offered by the company, this is one young craft whiskey worthy of its asking price.","Roaming Man is a quality young whiskey offered with a wealth of information from a company I had never heard of, but now that I have, I want to learn more.","Young whiskeys are everywhere, and the typical connection is with the whiskey’s maker, not necessarily the whiskey itself. Roaming Man is a young whiskey that’s good enough to stand on its own, and as a result it piques your curiosity as to what’s happening behind the scenes. Sugarlands’ label transparency is a whiskey lover’s dream, providing as much information as anyone could ask for. While this volume of information might be difficult to provide in larger production scenarios, it’s still something other whiskey makers should take note of and strive for whenever they can. If I’m ever down near Gatlinburg, Tennessee, I’m going to make it a point to visit Sugarlands Distilling Company.",Nick,2.5,2,3.5,3,2.5,2.5,https://www.breakingbourbon.com/review/roaming-man-straight-rye-cask-strength
,Russell’s Reserve 6 Year Rye,Classification: Straight Rye,Company: Campari Group,Distillery: Wild Turkey,Release Date: Ongoing,Proof: 90,Age: 6 Years,"Mashbill: 51% Rye, 37% Corn, 12% Malted Barley",Color: Golden Bronze,MSRP: $45 (2020),Official Website,"Russell’s Reserve 6 Year Old Rye is part of Wild Turkey’s Russell’s Reserve line named in honor of Jimmy and Eddie Russell, the father-son master distiller team that have a combined tenure at Wild Turkey in excess of 100 years. Like all of Wild Turkey’s rye whiskeys, it’s made from their single rye mashbill. This is also the only standard rye release Wild Turkey produces with an age statement.","The nose opens up with lighter scents of hay, vanilla, and a hint of oak. A swirl of the glass reveals an underlying theme of sweetness predominantly in the form of pink bubble gum. Overall light in delivery, it won’t wow you, but it’s a suitable way to open up the sip.","The sweetness from the nose carries over in the form of that light bubble gum along with a sweet caramel chew with vanilla coating. This is joined with a current of subtle rye spice that is underlying the entire time. It’s a pleasant collection of flavors, however the lower proof seems to hold back what could be a bolder and more full-flavored sip.","A small flare-up of heat starts things off in the form of rye spice and green peppercorn. These are combined with a hint of leather and vanilla, along with lightly aged oak that lingers for a considerable amount of time. The burst of heat at the start of the finish brings forth the most life the sip has to offer and is a nice way to round things out.","Russell’s Reserve 6 Year Rye joins a small group of age stated ryes. The most notable of which might be Pikesville 6 Year Rye, which costs only $5 more and delivers a bolder sip due to its 110 proof. However, looking more closely at the Wild Turkey family itself, Russell’s Reserve 6 Year Old Rye is the only age-stated standard release rye the company produces.

Age doesn’t necessarily guarantee success, and in the case of Russell’s Reserve 6 Year Rye, it’s clear that it has spent some time in the wood compared to more youthful and fruity tasting ryes in the marketplace such as Rittenhouse Rye. However, what is holding this rye back from being more unique and truly a rye-lover’s rye, is the fact that it’s bottled at only 90 proof. While you don’t need a 100+ proof to be a great whiskey, in this case it’s clear that the lower proof seems to result in a lack of depth, and holds back the rye from standing out in the crowd.","Russell’s Reserve 6 Year Rye’s price doesn’t do it any justice. While it comes in a nice looking bottle with a prominent age statement, it’s facing fierce competition in the rye category. Not only are their better tasting age-stated ryes available, such as the formerly mentioned Pikesville 6 Year Rye, Wild Turkey itself even competes with their own lineups. Wild Turkey 101 Rye, while not amazing, offers a similar tasting experience and comes in at $5 less for a liter bottle. Age usually brings a cost with it, but in this case, its average-tasting sip isn’t worth the asking price.","The only standard age-stated rye Wild Turkey makes, Russell’s Reserve 6 Year Old Rye delivers a good but forgettable sip due to its lack of boldness and lower proof.","Wild Turkey has never been known for their rye products. They tend to get drowned out by their bourbon counterparts, and for good reason. While Wild Turkey is capable of producing some fantastic bourbons, their rye products tend to hover around just being average to above average. Sure you might get a fantastic single barrel of Russell’s Reserve Rye, (unfortunately the one we reviewed wasn’t one) but for the most part, a solidly average rye is delivered.

Russell’s Reserve 6 Year Rye is no exception. The flavors are good, but muted due to its lower proof, and the overall sip ends up being an easy drinking average rye. It’s one of those times where you look at your glass and think - this isn’t bad, but it’s also not wowing me. You’ll be quick to forget the sip it delivers, but you also probably won’t turn down a glass if offered. There are better ryes available for the price, and unless you’re a hardcore Wild Turkey fan, you’re probably better off seeking out an alternative to scratch your rye itch.",Jordan,2.5,2.5,3,2.5,2,2.5,https://www.breakingbourbon.com/review/russells-reserve-6-year-rye
,Stanahan's Diamond Peak,Classification: Whiskey,Company: Proximo Spirits,Distillery: Stanahan's,Released: April 2015 / Ongoing,Proof: 94,Age: 4 Years,Mashbill: 100% Malted Barley,Color:  Amber,MSRP: $70 (2017),Official Website,"Stranahan's was founded by Jess Graber and George Stranahan, whom the whiskey is named after, in Colorado in 2004. The standard Stranahan’s Colorado Whiskey is a small batch straight whiskey consisting of 10-20 barrels that are aged a minimum of 2 years and a maximum of 5 years in new charred oak barrels.

For Diamond Peak, Stranahan’s used whiskey aged for 4 years to make this release. Like the standard version of Stranahan’s, Diamond Peak is made from 100% rocky mountain barley & water. The batch being reviewed is batch number 002, bottle number 1190, and was distilled by Rob Dietrich. Additionally Diamond Peak is topped with a black metal cap that can can be used to pour a perfect 3 ounce pour.","Mellow on the nose, which I found to be different than your typical American whiskey. Diamond Peak brings warm subtle scents to the table; hints of warm banana bread, cinnamon, spiced apples, and walnuts are present but very subtle. Additionally I’m picking up a hint of creamed corn, which I also found to be present in the standard version of Stranahan’s, however much lighter in the Diamond Peak version. This is slightly odd, since this is the equivalent of a 4 year malted scotch made with no corn.","The palate is sweet and light. Apple and oak are the first flavors to immediately pop out the moment I take a sip. Behind them I get hints of vanilla, honey, light toffee, and dried fruit. It’s a really nice flavor profile and one that quickly coats your whole mouth. You’ll want to hold this one in for just a few extra seconds before swallowing to make sure you notice all the subtle flavors the palate contains.","The finish brings a nice mix of heat and light flavors. An initial coating of warmth fills your mouth along with mixed dried fruit and dried apple slices. It’s a lighter flavor profile than preferred, but one that is still enjoyable.","I find the standard version of Stranahan’s to be a really unique product. It’s one of the few American single malts on the market and it offers a unique, bold flavor profile that you don’t find in any other bourbons or ryes in the market. I was hoping that Diamond Peak would improve on this uniqueness, however I walked away slightly disappointed. While I’d say it’s unique in its own right due to the limited batch runs the distillery is releasing, when compared directly to its sibling, Diamond Peak doesn’t seem quite that unique anymore. The in-your-face bold flavor profile of the standard Stranahan’s is gone, instead replaced with a much mellower, warmer flavor profile that doesn’t distinguish itself from other similarly aged bourbons and whiskeys as much.","I find the standard version of Stranahan’s to just be an average value for consumers. While in line with other craft distillery pricing, Stranahan’s still commands a price that I feel might be too high for some. With the standard Stranahan’s you’re getting a really unique whiskey experience that you normally don’t get with other craft products, however for $55 you’re also competing with some really great bourbons and ryes on the market. On top of that there remains a lot of talk around variation between batches which is somewhat concerning when taking the plunge to buy a bottle.

Diamond Peak comes in at $15 over the price of the standard version, which is a pretty steep increase. Sure you get to taste a pure 4 year old version of Stranahan’s, however I don’t feel the flavor profile backs up the price in this case. At $70 it falls in a weird middle-ground pricing wise, sitting a little higher than the standard version while much less than their bi-annual exclusive Snowflake release. With both the standard and Snowflake releases, you’re getting over-the-top unique flavor profiles. With Diamond Peak, you’re getting a much more mellow profile, that while pleasant, is overpriced for what it is.",Diamond Peak loses a lot of the in-your-face punch found in the standard Stranahan’s at a higher price point to boot.,"I was looking forward to seeing what a straight age stated small batch Stranahan’s would taste like in Diamond Peak versus the normal mix of 2-5 year old whiskeys you find in the standard Stranahan’s. The bold flavor profile is gone and instead replaced with a slightly sweeter much more toned down version in Diamond Peak. While not bad per say, it’s missing out on that great bold profile that I love in Stranahan’s and I feel it’s not worth the $15 price premium being charged either. I’d recommend readers try this in a bar before committing to a bottle, and only after they’ve tried standard Stranahan’s too.

What I’d really like to see is what Stranahan’s tastes like after sitting for several more years inside a barrel. I’d love to see master distiller Rob Dietrich release a version aged over 5 years that they wouldn’t use in the blend for the standard version. That would be a great way to show off how aging in Colorado affects the flavor profile, and give a sense of what the people at Stranahan’s are really capable of. Until that time, I’m left with a feeling that while unique as compared with many other American whiskeys, this product is overshadowed by its little brother, the standard version of Stranahan’s.",Jordan,3,3.5,2.5,2.5,2,2.5,https://www.breakingbourbon.com/review/stanahans-diamond-peak
,TX Texas Straight Bourbon,Classification: Straight Bourbon,Company: Firestone & Robertson Distilling Company,Distillery: Firestone & Robertson Distilling Company,Release Date: Ongoing,Proof: 90,Age: NAS,Mashbill: Undisclosed,Color: Dark Copper,MSRP: $50 (2019),Official Website,"In 2012, Leonard Firestone and Troy Robertson founded the Firestone & Robertson Distilling Co., which they state was the first craft bourbon and whiskey distillery in North Texas. While the mashbill percentages are not disclosed, Firestone & Robertson say it’s made up of Texas yellow dent corn, Texas soft red winter wheat, 6-row distillers malt, and their own proprietary strain of yeast that was captured from a Texas pecan nut — which they call the “Brazos.” No age statement is listed on the bottle, but it’s labeled as a straight bourbon making this at least four years old.","A blast of corn dominates upfront. A nice balance of fresh pecan pie, maple sugar candy, vanilla, banana, and a hint of oak follow. The nose conveys a hint of youth, but not in a negative way. This is a well balanced nose and a good start to the sip.","Soft and sweet - baking spices and pecan pie are noticeable at first, followed by brown butter and light vanilla. These are joined by a dash of peppery spice. While the spice adds an interesting presence, it seems to slightly throw off the great dynamic that the sweeter flavors develop. For such a mix of flavors I was also surprised at the lighter mouthfeel, and  when combined with the unbalanced pepper, holds this above average sip from going to the next level.","An ever-so-slight dash of sweetness kicks of the finish, however it’s replaced almost instantly by a peppery and oak mixture, which dominates the rest of the time. This flavor combination clings to your mouth for an extremely long time. While the length is a pleasant surprise, its one dimensional finish ends this bourbon on a downward note compared to how the sip started.","TX Bourbon is certainly different - both in how it’s created and the resulting flavor profile. While there is no legal definition of what it means to be defined as a Texas Bourbon, TX embodies the Texas spirit through and through by sourcing all the ingredients for the mashbill from Texas. This includes doing research on what yeast strain would work best for their needs, and then according to Firestone & Robertson, finding the yeast on a single Texas pecan nut of all places. Romantic backstory of the yeast aside, at the end of the day this dedication to trying new things is what can make craft distilling so unique and refreshing.

On the flavor side, these locally sourced ingredients come together in a great way that feels totally new compared to other whiskeys in the marketplace. Don’t equate that statement to mean it’s a slam dunk bourbon, because it’s not. Yet its flavor profile feels fresh and enjoyable and shows that Firestone & Robertson have the potential to turn this into a highly regarded bourbon one day.","The value of this bourbon can be compared two different ways. Priced at $50, it’s in line, if not slightly less than what many craft distillers charge for their product. And in many cases, the craft product is younger and less developed. When compared to more mainstream distillers though, the $50 is high for what the product actually is, a younger bourbon with a unique, yet average flavor profile. Price is always a subjective value, but in this case it feels like TX Bourbon is priced right for what it is.","A Texas take on America’s Native Spirit, TX Bourbon delivers a unique sip that shows promise for this young distillery.","TX Bourbon in its present configuration shows promise. While the sip is average overall, it shows flashes of how great this bourbon could be as Firestone & Robertson refine their craft. In the meantime, the unique mashbill, including the yeast strain used, delivers a sip that is worth seeking out to try.

,The Hilhaven Lodge Whiskey,Classification: Blend of Straight Whiskeys,Company: Diageo/T.H.L Whiskey Co.,Distillery: Sourced,Released: April 2016 / Ongoing,Proof: 80,Age: NAS,Mashbill: Undisclosed,Color:  Gold,MSRP: $50,Official Website,"The Hilhaven Lodge whiskey is a collaboration between Diageo and Hollywood director and current owner of The Hilhaven Lodge, Brett Ratner. The whiskey is a blend of a bourbon from the 2000’s, a Tennessee Whiskey from the 1990’s, and a rye whiskey from the 1980’s. It is hand-bottled at the historic Stitzel-Weller distillery. The initial rollout will be in California and Florida, and later expanding to DE, HI, IA, IL, KS, LA, MA, MN, MO, MT, NC, NE, NH, NV, NM, NJ, NY, SD, TX, VT, WI.","Light but also chipper thanks to a nice balance of its fruit notes. The citrusy and sweet scents are enjoyable, yet on the weak side, which is most likely due to the whiskey’s low proof. Caramel and vanilla provide a sturdy foundation that at times overpower additional scents of gingerbread, honey, and candied dark fruits. Not overly complex, but likable enough to make you forget that it isn’t.","It can be quite the whirlwind tasting experience for this light whiskey, which hides under a veil of such a low proof. The flavors don’t have much weight to them yet seemingly come at you all at once, fighting for your attention. Light fruit notes are compounded with a mishmash of caramel, vanilla, toffee, clove, leather, spice, and oak that don’t quite congeal into an easily understandable and refined package. None of it is bad per say, but far from a home run.","A spicy, rye-forward kick opens that ends on a oaky semi-dry finish. The transition from the beginning of the finish to the end is an enjoyable switcheroo. This blend of whiskeys creates an interesting metamorphosis of flavor on its finish, one that goes to show how interesting blends can be, yet ultimately shoots itself in its own foot with its lack of punch due to its low proof.","Blending is nothing new for whiskey, but an emerging trend of American whiskey blends from high-profile celebrities is. It’s doubtful if these celebrities have much to do with the actual sourcing, blending, and fine tuning of their whiskey’s flavor profile, but their clout brings an additional layer of awareness to their brand. It’s easy to look at these new products as cash-ins on a popular spirit category or sub-par in quality since their name isn’t generally associated with whiskey making, but it’s never safe to judge a book by its cover.

It’s an interesting choice for a blend to include three different types of whiskeys from three different decades. At first the whiskey does come across as having a unique taste thanks to the amount of different flavors hitting you all at once. The blend doesn’t taste overly young or old, nor overly cheap or expensive. There are few peaks and valleys in its flavor profile since all of the flavors hit with the same intensity. It’s only after tasting it a few times that this uniqueness begins to wear off along with your general interest.","Determining if a whiskey is a good value depends on what type of whiskey drinker you are. This seems to be true for this whiskey more than most. Diehards will balk at its $50 MSRP because of its 80 proof point and lack of information on its whiskeys’ origins, exact ages and percentages in the blend. It’s feasible that collectors will gladly shell out $50 for its stylish bottle, high-profile celebrity association, and its intriguing blend of three different types of whiskeys. Casual drinkers will likely see this whiskey as an enchanting curiosity, a step up from their normal go-to whiskeys and a potential shelf trophy to their growing collection. With many limited edition, high profile and ornate-looking bottles hitting the market over the past few years, The Hilhaven Lodge’s $50 MSRP is well within market acceptability. The price is probably going to be too high for most, mainly because of its proof, but there might be just enough going on with this blend to make some whiskey drinkers satisfied with their purchase.","A low proof and light flavor profile will be a turnoff for many, while others may find satisfaction in its drinkability and stylish bottle.","It’s easy to overlook this whiskey thanks to its low proof and lack of information on its origins and exact age of whiskeys used. This whiskey is meant to be easily sipped and enjoyed with a flavor profile that brings a bit more to the table than what you would find in an everyday shelf whiskey. It’s not overly complex or challenging, but soft enough thanks to its proof that almost anyone can enjoy sipping it neat. A better plan would have been to release the whiskey at a higher proof to win over diehards and allow casual drinkers the opportunity to drink it with a cube or two (as is, don’t dare putting ice or water in this one). There are definitely more complex and flavorful whiskeys on the market for less, but The Hilhaven Lodge is betting on style, a bit of substance, and a pretty package to win over the masses. It seems clear the makers of this whiskey were striving to create the ultimate sipping whiskey and maybe that’s a fool’s errand, but for some, they might have succeeded.

,Tincup American Whiskey,Classification: Whiskey,Company: Proximo Spirits,Distillery: Sourced (blend of bourbon from MGP and single malt whiskey from Stranahan’s),Release Date: Ongoing,Proof: 84,Age: NAS,"Mashbill: Blend of bourbon (64% Corn, 32% Rye, 4% Malted Barley) and single malt whiskey (100% Malted Barley)",Color: Light Hay,MSRP: $30 (2020),Official Website,"Founded by Jess Graber and originally introduced in 2014, Tincup American Whiskey is the company’s flagship product, and now referred to as the “Original.” The Tincup company is located in Tin Cup, Colorado, and like its sister company Stranahan’s, Tincup Whiskey is cut with Colorado’s Rocky Mountain Water. Tincup American Whiskey is a bourbon-style whiskey, combining a high-rye bourbon distilled and aged in Indiana, with a small amount of single malt distilled and aged in Colorado. Each whiskey used in the blend has been aged in char #3 barrels.","A waft of caramel combines with delicate baking spices and a hint of orange peel. The nose is quite light overall, requiring a deep inhale to pull out these scents. As a result it’s serviceable, but not necessarily memorable.","Light rye spice sets the tone, with sweet summer fruits and a dash of cinnamon coming forward on the backend. It has a light body with a thin mouthfeel, though it delivers slightly more oomph than the nose. This is to be expected at the low proof point, creating a level of approachability the masses will likely enjoy.","Tapering spice and crisp green apples come forth, but drop off quickly, making for a short but clean finish. Again there is nothing off-putting here, however there is nothing particularly notable either.","Tincup American Whiskey is a blend of predominantly high rye MGP bourbon and a small amount of single malt whiskey distilled at Tincup’s sister company, Stranahan’s. While the single malt component is said to be only a small portion of the blend, it does seem to influence the overall flavor profile enough to make this taste slightly different than you would expect from a high-rye MGP bourbon.

With that being said, Tincup American Whiskey’s low 84 proof does not do it any favors. While I understand the target market for this whiskey is not bourbon purists seeking higher proof, full-flavored pours, Tincup is ultimately thinner than I would like it to be. An additional 6-10 proof points might put this in better territory, which would also allow the single malt component more room to shine.","Everything about Tincup Whiskey screams fantastic marketing. The beautifully designed bottle topped with an eye-catching tin cup, is only surpassed in style by the company’s website and social media feeds featuring photos of rugged outdoorsmen sipping Tincup in front of snow-capped mountains. Because of this marketing, on the surface this would appear to command a high price tag, but the reality of the matter is Tincup American Whiskey retails for only $30. In today’s marketplace, it’s hard to complain about anything less than $30, and this is no exception. While it’s not a whiskey bourbon enthusiasts will get excited over, it certainly offers a reasonable price tag for those seeking a milder sipping experience.","Tincup’s flagship product, American Whiskey is geared towards those seeking a low proof, easy-sipping whiskey with a high-end look and feel.","Tincup’s packaging and marketing is really good, maybe a little too good. While my initial inclination is typically “great marketing is there to hide bad whiskey,” I have to remember that the target market for many whiskeys is not necessarily me. Moreover, effective marketing and nice package design should be embraced with any product type, and whiskey is no exception. Pulling past that, the price is surprisingly low given the look and feel of the bottle. There’s nothing wrong with the whiskey either, it’s completely serviceable and even slightly interesting, it’s just quite thin and light ultimately doing little to leave a lasting impression. However, if you prefer a lower proof and enjoy sweeter whiskeys, this is for you.",Nick,2.5,2.5,2.5,3,2.5,2.5,https://www.breakingbourbon.com/review/tincup-american-whiskey
,Tincup Straight Rye,Classification: Straight Rye,Company: Tincup,Distillery: MGP,Release Date: Ongoing,Proof: 90,Age: 3 Years,"Mashbill: 95% Rye, 5% Malted Barley",Color: Gold,Price: $30 (2020),Official Website,"The Tincup company is located in Tin Cup, Colorado. Like Stranahan’s, they use Rocky Mountain water to cut their whiskey. They also highlight the elevation on their bottles as 5,251’ above sea level. According to the company, Tincup Straight Rye is a salute to days before prohibition, when rye was the predominant spirit available and the drink of choice for Colorado’s mining pioneers.","A no-frills blend of young rye grain and spicy oak with lighter jabs of vanilla, orange, lemon, along with a slight hint of custard and dill. The scents are not an overpowering blend for a 90 proof rye. Straightforward above all else, it offers an aroma that is pleasant, but not overly flashy.","The first thing you’ll notice is the palates lightness. It flirts with being too watered down at first, until some of its sweet and spicy notes pull through. There’s also a slight creaminess that nicely adds another dimension. Mild notes of custard, baking spice, grass, and black pepper form a drinkable yet not overly exciting sip.","Some heat and spice ramp up during the finish which leaves a slightly hot and peppery aftertaste. These spicy notes remind you you’re drinking a rye, and perform well against the lighter palate. It’s not overly complex but nevertheless provides a necessary and serviceable part of the sip.","There’s no ignoring the fact that this is another young MGP rye. With the wealth of brands adding a rye whiskey to their portfolio, some choose to distill it themselves, and many choose to source from MGP. It’s hard to stand out from the MGP crowd when you almost exclusively have to rely on nuanced changes between barrels. Tin Cup tries to differentiate their products by cutting them with Rocky Mountain water. Despite so many brands claiming how great their local water is, it isn’t always clear as day how much water has an effect on the base whiskey.

Oddly enough though, Tincup Rye does have a certain spring water characteristic about it. For a rye, it is surprisingly mellow and easy drinking. It doesn’t necessarily come across as overly diluted, but is noticeably more mellow than you’d expect. Comparing it to Bulleit 95 Rye, which is also 90 proof and sourced from MGP, this is especially true. It has a creamier mouthfeel, softer palate, and is much more delicate. Flavorwise, there aren’t night and day differences, which is to be expected, but it's interesting to see the minute differences between the two, and how much more, dare I say it, smoother Tincup Rye is. It’s not a shockingly huge difference, but when many are sourcing from the same distillery, it makes a difference.","Before looking up its price, I expected Tincup Rye to be more expensive than it is. Based on how many small non-distiller producers and craft distillers price their products, and the fact that Tin Cup has one of the best bottle designs in the business, I expected it to cost more than its $30 price tag.

This price keeps it in line competitively with budget heavy-hitters like Old Forester Rye ($23), George Dickel Rye ($25), Jack Daniel’s Tennessee Rye ($27), Bulleit 95 Rye ($30), and Elijah Craig Rye ($30). It’s not as unique as Old Forester or Jack Daniel’s, or as sweet as Elijah Craig, but despite this and its overall straightforwardness, it's hard to balk at its price. Young MGP rye whiskey may not be the most exciting whiskey you can buy, but it's often quite reliable which is on display when comparing similarities between the multiple brands. This price segment of rye whiskeys is also priced strangely low compared to other types of whiskey. While the whiskey itself is a satisfying pour and value, in my opinion this whole group of budget whiskeys is probably priced too low and I wouldn’t be surprised by a price increase in the near future.",Tincup Straight Rye is an easy-drinking rye that softens some of rye whiskey’s traditional hard edges for a more mellow sip.,"What type of rye whiskey are you looking for? There’s a surprising amount of budget ryes on the market and they’re all priced extremely competitively against one another. So it helps to know a style you prefer before diving in. More often than not these budget-friendly ryes are straightforward and they know exactly what they are.

Tincup Rye is a whiskey that goes for drinkability above all else. For anyone that is shy about transitioning from bourbon to rye, Tincup Rye would be a great place to start. It’s a rye that still features rye’s traditional spice and heat, but offers it up in a much more mellow way. Those probably aren’t attributes hardcore rye fans and enthusiasts typically seek out, but it's clear that’s not who this whiskey is targeting. Not every whiskey has to be for everyone, and Tincup Rye knows what it is and what it has to offer.

,Widow Jane 10 Year Single Barrel Bourbon,Classification: Straight Bourbon,Company: Cacao Prieto,Distillery: Sourced (From an undisclosed distillery in Kentucky),Released: Ongoing,Proof: 91,Age: 10 Years,Mashbill: Undisclosed,Color: Copper,MSRP: $75 (2018),Official Website,"Widow Jane Distillery was founded in 2012 and is owned by Cacao Prieto. Founded by the inventor Daniel Prieto Preston, the company produces a number of whiskeys that are both sourced and distilled in-house. With an office in Brooklyn, NY and distillery 105 miles north of NYC in Red Hook, NY, the whiskey gets its name due to the fact that the company uses water that comes from the Widow Jane Mines in Rosendale, NY. The bourbon is produced in Kentucky and brought to New York for proofing and bottling.

This is a single barrel bourbon, which means each barrel will present a slightly different flavor profile. For this review, the bottle being reviewed was bottled in 2017, from barrel number 1579, and bottle number 173.

For this review, we presented our Patreon Supporters four different bourbons to vote on with the winner being the next bourbon we reviewed. If you would like to have a say in our next monthly Patreon Supporter interaction, sponsor us at the $1 per month or higher level.","Classic bourbon traits waft to the forefront including corn, oak, barrel char, and vanilla. Beneath lay slight hints of apple and raisins. As can be expected for a 91 proof bourbon, there is no ethanol present at all. Sans the flavors themselves being slightly muted, overall the nose is everything you would want out of a classic style bourbon.",The palate starts surprisingly sweet with corn and vanilla mixed with light orange and cherry. There is a surprising dose of heat comprised of rye spice and pepper which commingle nicely with the flavors. For a 10 year old bourbon the lack of oak in the palate is surprising. A really pleasant sip.,"The heat flares up at the start of the finish, but quickly subsides. What remains is a very weird mix of flavors. A dose of pepper is present along with a strange astringent taste that tickles the back of my throat. This is further mixed with a soap-like oaky flavor profile. This lingers for a while, and unfortunately ends this bourbon on a sour note. To be sure it wasn’t my glass, I tried out a different glencairn that I cleaned thoroughly with water, and had the same result.","A Kentucky sourced bourbon that’s proofed down with limestone water from New York. It’s an interesting enough story to a degree, and the bourbon somewhat hits its mark. Make no mistake, there is no mingling of barrels or blending going on. This is just a straight proofing down of a sourced bourbon using local limestone filtered water. While I’m sure the company loves this process, many non-distiller producers (NDP) do just this and the end result is a drinkable, traditional tasting bourbon. Besides the odd tasting finish, the flavor profile isn’t all that unique or memorable overall, and I’d be hard pressed to pick this out of a blind tasting.","The value on this bourbon really presented a conundrum for me. On the surface this bourbon seems like it’s overpriced from a pure cost perspective. After all, $75 for a sourced bourbon is on the expensive side, especially when you stop to think that Henry McKenna 10 Year Single Barrel retails for $30. Sure it's not sourced, but shares the 10 year age statement, single barrel status, and has Kentucky origins.

In-house distilled whiskeys tend to be the exception to the norm. Sourced bourbon like Rebel Yell 10 Year Single Barrel falls in the $60 range, and  Michter's 10 Year Single Barrel falls in the $120 range. While these aren’t apple to apples comparisons in terms of flavor profile, from a sourced product and age range perspective, it gives a decent comparison. Looking at it this way, Widow Jane 10 Year seems to be priced appropriately for the market.

However in the end you have to take the actual product into account as being a single barrel doesn’t automatically mean it’s a great product. In Widow Jane’s case, the nose and palate are really enjoyable, but the finish ends on such a poor note that is simply hard to ignore. While it may just be the barrel my bottle came from, at $75 I’m left feeling disappointed.","Widow Jane 10 Year Single Barrel is a good reminder that no matter how you start, it’s how you finish that’s remembered, and sadly this pour stumbles across the finish line.","Widow Jane 10 Year Single Barrel serves as a good example of the risks NDPs take when purchasing sourced barrels. This bottle of Widow Jane 10 Year Single Barrel started with so much potential but ended on a caustic whimper. While each barrel will be slightly different, it’s a letdown to know that the end result wasn’t well rounded overall. It serves as a reminder that this is the risk a consumer also takes when buying single barrel products. It wouldn’t stop me from buying another bottle, however due to the price, I would hesitate before pulling the trigger again.",Jordan,3,3,1.5,2.5,2,2.5,https://www.breakingbourbon.com/review/widow-jane-10-year-single-barrel-bourbon
,Wild Turkey 101 Rye,Classification: Straight Bourbon,Company: Campari Group,Distillery: Wild Turkey,Released: Ongoing,Proof: 101,Age: NAS,"Mashbill: 51% Rye, 37% Corn, 12% Malted Barley",Color: Straw,MSRP: $40 (Liter),Official Website,"Wild Turkey 101 Rye was once a mainstay in the rye whiskey section of a liquor store. In 2012, Wild Turkey released an 81 proof version due to supply restraints and announced that 101 Rye would be put on allocation. The bottle was quickly bought up and disappeared from store shelves. A year later the company announced Wild Turkey 101 Rye’s return, but that turned out to be somewhat superficial, as it was only found in select bars and restaurants. This is slowly changing, as there has been a trickle of Wild Turkey 101 Rye to retail shelves over the past few years. It now sports a new 1 liter bottle, higher price tag, and  Wild Turkey’s 2016 label redesign.","A lively bouquet of caramel, honey, grain, and mint appear overtop of fainter hints of bubblegum, creme brulee, baking spices, and oak. The aromas blend well together and play off one another, yet still retain their original characteristics. The notes are enjoyable and robust like many rye whiskeys, yet still soft enough to keep the nose from being harsh.","At first sip, the intensity of its proof immediately fills my throat and nose with hardy grain and spice. Tucked underneath are more delicates notes of mint, oatmeal, and apple, but they struggle for equal attention. Despite these additional flavors waiting in the wings, the palate comes off as a bit basic because of the dominance of rye spice. It’s also worth noting the whiskey’s slight buttery consistency, combined with additional oak notes, goes a long way making up for some of the palate’s straightforward simplicity.","The medium length finish leaves a hot, cinnamon, and spicy aftertaste. As it dissipates, the whiskey’s oak influence becomes even more noticeable as woody notes overtake the spice. A dry aftertaste then develops in the whiskey’s final act. There are few surprises thanks to a straightforward and somewhat predictable rye finish.","Wild Turkey 101 Rye was once (and possibly still is) the quintessential rye whiskey. People that are newer to whiskey might not even realize there is such a thing as Wild Turkey 101 Rye, since due to supply constraints, it isn’t found in many stores. With the rye revival and MGP-produced rye whiskeys flooding the shelves, Wild Turkey’s rye whiskeys seem to be diminishing in the public conscience. The company may speak of high demand, but when was the last time anyone spoke fondly of the 81 proof version and how many are even aware of the fact that a 101 proof version exists anymore?

It really comes down to the fact that the 81 proof version replaced Wild Turkey 101 Rye as a workhorse whiskey. There aren’t a lot of bells and whistles on display here. For rye drinkers looking for a more complex sip from Wild Turkey, they’re pointed in the direction of the more expensive and unique Russell's Reserve Rye. Wild Turkey 101 Rye is simply a get-down-to-business kind of whiskey.","Because of Wild Turkey 101 Rye’s dispersed and somewhat shadowy availability throughout the country, the price of it varies greatly. Sold in liter bottles, and ranging from $35-$45, it’s teetering on the high side for what it is. It’s an adequate sipper at best, as its palate errs a bit on the basic side for that aspect. It works well in cocktails thanks to its proof and spicy traits, but again, its basic composition doesn’t bring much additional complexity to a cocktail. Of course some may enjoy that very aspect of this whiskey, but unlike its 101 proof bourbon brother which is priced right, Wild Turkey 101 Rye’s price and limited availability do the whiskey a disservice. But if you’re lucky and live in a market that still prices it closer to $30 than $40, this deserves a place on your shelf.","Wild Turkey 101 Rye packs few surprises, but can be relied upon as a quality, nicely proofed, straightforward rye whiskey.","There’s no doubting the quality of Wild Turkey 101 Rye. Wild Turkey’s almost 40 years experience distilling rye whiskey shines through despite the whiskey’s basic nature. It wasn’t too long ago this was a budget whiskey before demand outstripped supply and it was slapped with allocation status. It’s a shame since the 81 proof version just doesn’t cut it in comparison. It also would be great to see this budget priced again and standing side by side with Wild Turkey 101 Bourbon. There are definitely whiskey drinkers that still have a lot of love for Wild Turkey 101 Rye, but it doesn’t appear that the company shares in that same intensity for it right now. Their focus has shifted to the more premium Russell’s Reserve line and they have even used some of their rye whiskey stock for the special release of Wild Turkey Forgiven.

Thankfully Wild Turkey 101 Rye is slowly making it’s way back to the market and can be easily found at many online shops. As its price slowly creeps up closer and closer to Russell’s Reserve’s, its perceived value and reason for existence becomes dimmer by the day. But if you can find it at the right price, it can definitely still be a great workhorse rye whiskey for you.",Eric,3,2.5,2.5,2,2,2.5,https://www.breakingbourbon.com/review/wild-turkey-101-rye
,Willett Exploratory Cask Finish Version 1.0,Classification: Rye,Company: The Willett Distillery (also known as Kentucky Bourbon Distillers Ltd.),"Distillery: MGP, aged and finished by Willett",Released: November 2014,Proof: 103.4,Age: 7 years aged and ~90 days finished,"Mashbill: 95% Rye, 5% Malted Barley",Color:  Dark Copper,MSRP: $140,Official Website,"This is the first time that Willett has released an Exploratory Cask Finish which is commonly referred to as XCF 1.0. For the first release, a 7 year-old American Rye Whiskey was finished in Curacao Casks, which were sourced from France, for approximately 90 days. Curacao Casks are used to make Curacao which is a liqueur flavored with the dried peel of the laraha citrus fruit grown on the island of Curacao. Because these barrels were imported from France an unconfirmed rumor is that they were previously used in the production of Grand Marnier. The rye used was most likely sourced from MGP in Indiana and aged and finished at the Willett property in Bardstown, Kentucky. 6,912 Bottles were produced.","The first scent to hit my nose is orange…and a lot of it! The orange is both a citrusy scent along with a distinctive orange rind aroma. Beneath that I smell light rye notes mixed with oak trying to break through. Those rye notes however, have a hard time pushing past the orange profile which really dominates the nose here. Not unpleasant, but not quite the profile I’m going after either when I want to drink a whiskey.","Wow is this a funky palate! Orange is still very much upfront and present, along with distinctive notes of a thin sugar molasses, fresh wood, allspice, white pepper and rye. The palate is both distinctly sweet and ever so slightly spicy. It actually nails exactly what I would expect from aging a rye in a Curacao barrel. A well balanced mix of citrus and rye.","The finish is light and airy to start. The sweet taste of orange is present, however, much less so than what was found in the nose and palate. Instead, you mainly find a more traditional finish that you would with a young rye, with earthy woody notes mingled with rye spice and light pepper. The finish lingers for awhile and continuously morphs from light and airy to an increasingly drier level as time went on. The initial sweet flavors morph to a leathery old wood taste that made it seem older than the seven years it spent in the barrel and not necessarily in a good way.","You have to hand it to Willett on this one, as this has to be one of the more unique products on the market. While you see so many barrel finished whiskeys, many have been aged in wine barrels while so few have been successfully aged in other spirit barrels. Angel’s Envy Rye immediately pops into my mind as an exception due to it being aged in used rum barrels, however the flavor profile is so different and much too sweet to make it a fair comparison. Additionally, Willett took the time to import the barrels from France and chose a liquor that pairs decently with a rye. Whether you love it or you hate it, nothing on the market truly tastes like XCF.","While barrel finished whiskeys are all the rage nowadays, at $140 this is one pricey bottle. While other barrel finished whiskeys are selling for around $100 or less (e.g. Angels Envy Rye, High West A Midwinter Night’s Dram), Willett has chosen a price that you’d normally see on the secondary market. I have a hard time justifying the price tag being charged for XCF. Yes it’s tasty and very unique, however, it’s being sold for about $40-50 more than it should be. Sure it costs money to import barrels from France, however greed seems to have gotten the better of Willet on this one. Hopefully we don’t see more distillers pricing their new products at perceived secondary pricing like Willett did, as it scares me to think what the future bourbon market may look like.","A unique experiment with an interesting result, at an unfortunately unjustifiable price tag.","Not bad per say, however, XCF definitely tasted like a Frankenstein rye to me that you might try to make by mixing whiskey with some liquors to sweeten it up. That being said, it was so different that I actually dug it. Not enough to want to drink a glass every day or recommend buying a full bottle, but enough to recommend it as fun novelty for others to try once at a bar.

I feel like Willett tried to appeal to a broader audience with XCF by sweetening up a rye to make it more appealing to non-bourbon drinkers. You see this as a trend in the marketplace with flavor enhanced whiskeys such as Wild Turkey Honey or the Evan Williams Cinnamon Reserve, however in this case Willett actually took the time to use a barrel finishing technique. The problem is that Willett makes you pay through the nose for letting them barrel finish this rye. So much so that I can’t imagine a casual drinker looking for a sweeter profile wanting to pay $140 to try this.",Jordan,2.5,4,2,4.5,1.5,2.5,https://www.breakingbourbon.com/review/willett-exploratory-cask-finish-version-1-0
,Woodford Reserve Distiller's Select Bourbon,Classification: Straight Bourbon,Company: Brown-Forman,Distillery: Woodford Reserve Distillery / Brown-Forman Distillery,Released: Ongoing,Proof: 90.4,Age: NAS,"Mashbill: 72% Corn, 18% Rye, 10% Malted Barley",Color: Copper,MSRP: $35 (2017),Official Website,"The Woodford Reserve brand comes from a storied past. It’s distilled and bottled at the the old Labrot & Graham’s Distillery, which started operations in 1780. Through the years the site has been home to several different whiskeys including Early Times, which was the most recent whiskey to be produced on the site prior to Woodford Reserve. While production stopped and the distillery was abandoned in 1973, it was eventually repurchased by Brown-Forman in 1993 and Woodford Reserve Distiller’s Select was launched in 1996 as a “new breed of premium bourbon.”

Woodford Reserve Distiller’s Select Bourbon consists of a mixture of pot still whiskey distilled at the company's Woodford Reserve Distillery in Woodford County, and column still spirits from the Brown-Forman Distillery in Shively, Kentucky. The exact mixture ratio is undisclosed, however considering the distilling capacity at the Woodford Reserve Distillery, it most likely leans to a large volume of barrels from the Brown-Forman Distillery in the mixture.

Woodford Reserve is also the official bourbon of the Kentucky Derby. Ironically even though Woodford is the official bourbon, Brown-Forman’s Old Forester serves as the bourbon base in the official drink of the Kentucky Derby, The Mint Julep.","Simple classic bourbon scents of vanilla, honey, and light oak intermingle with light hints of orange rind and graham cracker. These are all topped with a surprising amount of ethanol. While it isn’t overly harsh, it seems odd for such a low proof bourbon. Ethanol aside, this is a low key nose with scents that are simple enough to enjoy for even a bourbon novice.","Slightly sweet and thin, the palate delivers light flavors of vanilla, honey, and citrus which rest over a thin layer of rye and oak. The ethanol that was noticeable in the nose is nowhere to be found in the palate. In fact this drinks very light and if I went into this blind, I would have guessed this to be an 80 proof bourbon based on intensity alone. The flavors aren’t bad per say, but the palate is incredibly thin and leaves me wanting more.","Green pepper, aged oak, leather, and hints of tobacco are all noticeable up front. As the finish lingers, it gives way to a slow burn with dry leather and a slight hint of tobacco lingering for a while. It contrasts the nose and palate in that the sweetness takes a backseat, but not necessarily in a bad way. It’s simple nature works well and the low proof makes this very easy to sip and enjoy.","When Woodford Reserve Distiller’s Select Bourbon first came out, it was at a time when charging $30 plus for an everyday bottle of bourbon was unusual. Those were the days before special releases like the Buffalo Trace Antique Collection or other high end yearly releases from the likes of Wild Turkey or Jim Beam flew off the shelves at much higher price points. Woodford Reserve tried to make bourbon cool again by bringing out a bold new bottle design and charging a premium price.

Fast forward over 20 years, and what once was considered premium bourbon, now gets lost in the mix of hundreds of other bourbons on the market. That said, Woodford was actually able to maintain that perceived premium feeling with great marketing. From the unique bottle design that continues to stand out on bar shelves to this day, to its sponsoring the KY Derby, to its almost ubiquitous nature of being associated with bourbon-based manhattan cocktails, it manages to find ways to stay relevant.

Woodford Reserve Distiller’s Select was the first bourbon that got me hooked on actually drinking bourbon straight and then neat when I was living in Kentucky years ago. While I’ve since long past moved on from reaching for a glass of it neat, I still think it makes for a nice subtle bourbon cocktail. A little of it is the marketing magic that Brown-Forman has engrained in me, but more importantly, its unobtrusive flavor profile allows the rest of the components of a cocktail to shine through and enhance the overall drink. This combined with the fact that I can find it in most bars, is what allows Woodford Reserve to continue to stay relevant in my book.","Here is a bourbon that for over 20 years hasn’t gone up in price that much compared to many of its peers. Priced at $35 a bottle, it seems like this should be a great value for a bourbon in today's marketplace. That said, the market is much different from when Woodford Reserve Distiller’s Select was first introduced in 1996. The plethora of choices consumers now have means what once was considered premium is now considered a bit mundane. Sure you may get a unique looking bottle, but there are many bourbons in the $20-$40 range that deliver a better flavor profile for the money compared to Distiller’s Select. I would prefer to see this sold for $25-$30, as I feel that would be a fair asking price for what you’re getting.","While it doesn’t hold the status it once did, Woodford Reserve Distiller’s Select manages to still serve a purpose in today's marketplace.","Time is a funny thing. Had this review been done in 1996 it would have most likely read a lot differently. Here is a whiskey that tried to solidify not only a new premium bourbon category, but one that was readily accepted by consumers. It had an edgy bottle design for the time, a high price and an easy to appreciate flavor profile to go with it. But you can’t rest on your laurels forever.

Woodford Reserve Distiller’s Select may not be as relevant as it once was in the marketplace, however it still serves a purpose. Its simple flavor profile offers a way to dive into bourbon without being overwhelmed by worrying about trying to pick out exotic flavor characteristics. Additionally, for those who have since moved on from drinking it neat, it still offers a good base for cocktails due to its straightforward and approachable flavor profile that doesn’t overpower the drink. There’s still a time and place for Distiller’s Select, but it's just not as exciting as it once was.",Jordan,2.5,2,2.5,2.5,2,2.5,https://www.breakingbourbon.com/review/woodford-reserve-distillers-select-bourbon
,Woodford Reserve Master's Collection Brandy Cask Finish,Classification: Straight Bourbon Finished in Brandy Barrels,Company: Brown-Forman,Distillery: Woodford Reserve / Brown-Forman Distillery,Released: November 2016,Proof: 90.4,Age: NAS,"Mashbill: 72% Corn, 18% Rye, 10% Malted Barley",Color: Copper,MSRP: $100,Official Website,"Every year, Brown-Forman’s Master Distiller Chris Morris releases a special edition of Woodford Reserve called the Master’s Collection. For each release, Morris changes some aspect of the whiskey making process (e.g. barrel type, finish, grain, fermentation process, aging location, style). The Brandy Cask Finish is the 11th release of the Master’s Collection.

For the 2016 Master’s Collection release, fully matured Woodford Reserve was finished for two years in used brandy barrels. According to Brown-Forman, “brandy, a spirit distilled from wine or fruit, is often aged in oak barrels. Unlike bourbon, brandy does not have the new, charred barrel requirement allowing their barrels to be used multiple times. Therefore, this release is technically not a bourbon but rather a finished whiskey.”","Lush fruits instantly jump out the moment I bring the glass to my nose. Warm spiced cherries mingle with berry filled cobbler topped with a hint of cranberry. Cinnamon bark, baking chocolate, and hints of light oak form the base. The nose is very warm and inviting and makes me wish standard Woodford smelled this way.","It’s not as grain forward as standard Woodford Reserve, but instead has a quick burst of light berry sweetness that is followed by a drier oakier taste. It presents the usual thin mouthfeel I find in standard Woodford Reserve, however in this case, it’s an actual fault of this whiskey. It’s too delicate and in a way it feels like the whiskey is purposely trying to not coat my mouth. I feel I’m trying to wrestle this whiskey to even taste it, which is a bit of a shame since there are traces of good flavors here if only they could be pinned down easily.","While the nose and palate do a good job of helping highlight the brandy finishing on the whiskey, the finish reminds me more of a standard Woodford Reserve finish. Gone is the berry sweetness found in the nose and palate. Instead, a lingering buttery finish is present that provides a quick hit of green apple, hay, grass, and dried raisins before slowly mellowing out to light oak. It peters out into a drier astringent note, which almost ruins the whole experience. Thankfully whiskeys aren’t determined after just one sip. After sitting with it for a while and getting acclimated to it, the astringent note becomes less and less overpowering and more a slight flaw rather than something that really takes away from the experience.","Barrel finished whiskey seems to be all the rage with many distillers using it as a way to help launch new and unique products in the market. That said, barrel finished whiskeys aren’t anything new to the Woodford Master's Collection. Sometimes it’s worked well and sometimes it hasn’t, as was the case with the 2014 Woodford Master's Collection: Sonoma-Cutrer Finish. What makes this release more unique is the fact that they chose brandy barrels, a finishing type that is still rare to finish whiskey in.

Flavorwise, this year's Brandy Cask Finish delivered a pleasant surprise. The flavor profile is one solidly rooted in the Woodford’s lineage, but enhanced to pull a more fruit forward flavor profile vs the more predominant grain found in standard Woodford Reserve. While Woodford Reserve is usually nothing to write home about, the brandy finishing ever so slightly enhances it into a more exciting product. It may not blow you away, but in a side by side comparison to standard Woodford Reserve, it’s definitely a more pleasant drinking experience.","Credit should be given to Brown-Forman for keeping the price consistent for the Master’s Collection since its initial release. That said, a major downside to the Woodford Master's Collection has always been its price tag. Coming in at a $60+ premium over the standard Woodford MSRP, the Master’s Collection has offered an inconsistent experience from year to year making it difficult to justify the price.

While the whiskey in this year’s collection is actually enjoyable, it’s not spectacular enough to justify the price tag unlike recent additions to the barrel finished category; High West A Midwinter Night's Dram, 1792 Port Finish, or Angel's Envy Rye. Take 1792 Port Finish for example. It was also aged for two additional years, except in port barrels, but still offered up a great tasting experience for only $40. Maybe brandy barrels cost more to acquire, but surely the price difference isn’t enough to justify a $60 price differential.","While overpriced, this year's Woodford Master’s Collection offers a pleasant change of pace from recent lackluster releases.","I’ll be the first to admit that I’m a sucker for the Woodford Master's Collection. The 2005/2006 Four Grain Master’s Collection was released when I was still living in Kentucky and it was one of the first limited edition bottles I bought. Every year since, I’ve bought a bottle of the collection, with my expectation for the line slowly decreasing as the releases have become more and more lackluster over the years. This is to say that I went into this tasting with very low expectations.

Surprisingly, I’m walking away from my experience slightly pleased. Sure the whiskey in this year’s release isn’t mind-blowing, but it isn’t too bad either. It takes standard Woodford Reserve and pulls out more fruit-filled flavors than what you normally find. It may not be the best example of how barrel finishing can enhance a whiskey, but it’s at least much better than recent Master’s Collection releases. Here’s hoping that this sets a precedent for future releases and things start looking up for this series.

That said, while the bourbon market is on fire, and barrel finished products may be taking the market by storm, this is one product line that could greatly benefit from a reduction down to $70-$80 MSRP. Saying that it’s one of the better Master’s Collection releases in recent memory does nothing to justify the over inflated price tag. If you’re a huge fan of the Master’s Collection series or a big Woodford fan, you might be able to justify your purchase of this year’s release, but everyone else should realize you’re rolling the dice with this collection. That shouldn’t stop anyone from giving this year's release a shot, just know what you’re getting yourself into.

,Woodford Reserve Toasted Oak Rye,Classification: Rye,Company: Brown-Forman,Distillery: Woodford Reserve Distillery / Brown-Forman Distillery,Released: Summer 2017,Proof: 90.4,Age: NAS,"Mashbill: 53% Rye, 33% Corn, 14% Malted Barley",Color: Dark Copper,MSRP: $50 (375ml) (2017),,"Falling under the company’s Distillery Series, Woodford Reserve Toasted Oak Rye is a limited release which can be found only at the Woodford Distillery gift shop in 375ml bottles. Toasted Oak rye is the second of three ryes that will be highlighted in the Distillery Series this summer. Along with Toasted Oak Rye, the series consists of Blended Rye, and a specialty barrel-finished rye.

Woodford Reserve Toasted Oak Rye is a unique variation in maturation as compared to their continuously produced Woodford Reserve Distiller’s Select Rye. For this release, Brown-Forman states that the rye consists of “rye mash distillate matured in used Woodford Reserve Distiller's Select Bourbon barrels and re-barreled (finished) in new Woodford Reserve Double Oaked barrels for two years.” These Double Oaked barrels themselves deviate from a standard barrel used for standard Woodford Distiller's Select, due to the fact that they are deeply toasted before being lightly charred. No further aging information was provided.

The bottle being reviewed is from the Summer 2017 release, which at the time of this review is still being sold in the gift shop.","Initially sweet fragrances of vanilla, light rye spice, and a dab of caramel and toasted sugar are present. After lingering for a while and being exposed to a bit of air, the finishing, presumably from the Double Oaked barrels, begins to pull through adding aged oak to the fray that rounds out the experience. It’s a subtle addition that plays well with the sweet fragrances in an overall subtle nose.","The sweetness carries through to the palate. Sweet cherries, butterscotch, and vanilla intertwine with doses of tannic wood. Not a trace of dominating rye spice in this palate, although this shouldn’t come as a complete surprise though, as Distiller’s Select Rye also doesn’t contain an overpowering rye profile. While the end result is certainly tasty, finishing in new and used bourbon barrels lessens whatever hope this rye had of tasting like a traditional rye, and instead moves the palate closer to tasting like a bourbon.","The finish is dry throughout. Butterscotch, leather, and aged wood are all immediately noticeable. It rounds out on notes of subtle rye spice, dry pepper, and leather, with a warming heat lingering slightly in the background. The delivery of these flavors however are mundane and this is the weakest link in the overall flavor profile.","From a pure maturation and finishing process, this is an interesting whiskey. It starts with maturing the rye in used Woodford Distiller’s Select Bourbon barrels for an undisclosed amount of time. The rye is then transferred over to new Double Oaked barrels for 2 years of finishing thus the naming for this release.

I find standard Woodford Distiller’s Select Rye to be too subtle for a rye offering, lacking strong rye characteristics and leaning heavy on bourbon ones. I was hoping Toasted Oak Rye’s maturation and finishing process would bring something new to the experience or at least offer a very unique flavor profile. While the use of used and new bourbon barrels adds oak and tannic flavors to the equation, it doesn’t do much to really enhance it, or to really stand out among other barrel finished ryes in the market such as Angel’s Envy Rye or High West Double Rye releases that are finished in Campfire or Manhattanbarrels. With Toasted Oak Rye, you get a unique maturation and finishing backstory with an average end result.","I felt that Woodford’s Blended Rye could easily own up to its $50 price tag, but I don’t walk away feeling the same about Toasted Oak Rye. The flavor profile is just average, and while it’s interesting to have it finished in Double Oaked barrels for two years, overall it isn’t advancing Woodford’s Rye line. Add in the fact that this is only sold in 375ml bottles, and I have a hard time saying that this is money well spent.","While slightly more enjoyable than the standard Woodford Rye, Toasted Oak Rye doesn’t quite live up to the bar set by its recently released Blended Rye sibling.","I had high hopes for this rye based on how well Blended Rye came out. The first rye release in this Distillery Series really showed off Woodford’s capabilities of crafting a great rye. Unfortunately this is not the case this time around. The end result of the time spent in both Woodford Distiller’s Select and Double Oaked barrels results in an overall muddled rye experience in comparison to Blended Rye. That said, credit is due to Woodford for giving this a go and developing their rye brand further, as it makes me look forward to seeing what their upcoming third release in the series brings in comparison.

In Depth Review,1792 Full Proof,Straight Bourbon,Sazerac Company Inc.,Barton 1792 Distillery,May 2016,125,NAS (Press Release states 8.5 years),"Undisclosed (Rumored to be around 75% corn, 15% rye, 10% malted barley)",Copper,$45 (2016),,"This is the fourth new brand extension in the 1792 portfolio, along with Sweet Wheat, Port Finish, and Single Barrel. Described by Barton as a “high rye” bourbon, the bourbon used in this bottling skipped the traditional chill filtering that Barton normally uses, and instead was only passed through a plate and frame filter. This bourbon’s name is derived from the fact that it’s been bottled at it’s original 125 barrel entry proof. While this isn’t a barrel proof offering (due to the fact it was watered down slightly to achieve this proof), it is the highest proof 1792 offering to date.","The alcohol is immediately noticeable and jumps right out of the glass. Hiding behind the alcohol are dry oak, caramel, and a dab of vanilla. While these classic bourbon scents are appreciated, they’re quickly forgotten, and combined with the ever present alcohol, it leaves a lot to be desired.","Sweeter than the nose would lead you to believe. Sweet corn, cinnamon, syrup-soaked raisins, dried cherries, and a dash of vanilla are all present. While it contains a lot of heat, the palate is still very pleasant and the star of the show, offering a really nice mouthfeel and is easy to appreciate at its full proof (no pun intended).","The heat ramps up big time and is immediately noticeable the moment the finish starts. The heat lingers for quite a while overpowering all other flavors, before eventually fading away into bar soap, musty oak, white pepper, and wet grass. It’s a funky combination that isn’t traditional and it’s just not exactly what I’m looking for in a bourbon.","Barton has released a wide range of extensions based on its original 1792 Small Batch offering. Prior releases such as Sweet Wheat and Port Finish have been pleasantly surprising, and I had high hopes for a higher proof 1792 release. An often praised brand releasing a high proof, 8.5 year bourbon is something to get exciting about. Mind you I was hoping for this to be a barrel proof offering, but since it was being watered down to 125 proof and offered at barrel entry proof, I figured this was the ideal heat and flavor profile Barton was aiming for this release. Boy was I wrong. Compared to a pour of 1792 Small Batch, this is an amped up version that goes for fire over flavor. It’s hard to drink this and not notice how off-balancing the heat is. Additionally, the overall flavor profile is underwhelming and leaves a lot to be desired. Sure the palate is really enjoyable, but you have to put up with the lackluster nose and funky hot finish to be able to appreciate it.
Barton tried to separate 1792 Full Proof from the pack of other high proof offerings by releasing this bourbon at the same proof as its entry proof was into the barrel. Which when you think about it, is understandable since every brand wants a unique differentiator behind their offering. However after tasting this bourbon and seeing the large focus on the fact that it is coming out at the same proof as it’s going in, almost seems gimmicky to me now considering the flavor profile it presents. It really makes me wonder how unbalanced 1792 really is when dumped straight from the barrel.

","$45 for a high proof bourbon that is as high or higher than some barrel proof bourbons doesn’t seem too bad on paper. In fact it’s one of the cheaper 120+ proof bourbons on the market. Compared to say Stagg Jrof Elijah Craig Barrel Proof, 1792 Full Proof is less expensive, but then again, those also tend to come in at higher proof points. The truth of the matter is that this is a subpar bourbon that doesn’t deliver on the price point. There are a lot of other great bourbons in the $40-$50 price range that I would readily recommend before this. In fact, Knob Creek Single Barrel is also proofed down to almost the same proof, but offers a much more enjoyable drinking experience. This is one of those cases where higher proof doesn’t equate to better value in my book.

","All the parts may be there, but 1792 Full Proof delivers a surprisingly unbalanced experience that will leave you scratching your head over what’s not adding up.","While I like the standard 1792 Small Batch, and have been a fan of the other expressions Barton has released, I just can’t get behind 1792 Full Proof. I wanted this bourbon to work and I wanted to walk away loving it. It has all the right parts in terms of price, proof, and a very pleasant palate. Unfortunately though, this just seems like a much hotter version of 1792 Small Batch. The heat is to be expected for a bourbon of this proof, however it comes across as unbalanced and sometimes overbearing in this case. Maybe a lot of time in the bottle to air out will serve it well, but in the meantime even adding a few drops of water doesn’t do much to balance things out. If you’re chasing hot bourbons, you may be a fan of 1792 Full Proof, but if you’re looking for a bourbon that’s high in proof and high in flavor, look elsewhere.",Jordan,2,3,2,2.5,2,2,https://www.breakingbourbon.com/review/1792-full-proof
,2bar Bourbon,Classification: Bourbon,Company: 2Bar Spirits,Distillery: 2Bar Spirits,Released: June 2014 / Ongoing,Proof: 100,Age: 9 Months,Mashbill: Undisclosed,Color:  Honey,MSRP: $50 (2016),Official Website,"2bar Bourbon is the first Seattle Bourbon to be 100% handmade from all local grains. While an exact mashbill is not provided, 2Bar Distillery does state that the mash is 90% Washington grain and 10% Oregon grain, making this truly a Pacific Northwest product. The bourbon is aged for 9 months in a 15 gallon barrel.","Bringing the glass of 2Bar spirits up to my nose, I was blasted with a rush of corn. Unfortunately I didn’t pick up much else. This has the smell of a young bourbon for sure with lots of the grain present.","2Bar surprisingly had a really good mouth feel after the lackluster nose, in fact, it was almost scotch like. Not surprising, however, is that fact that the grain is very up front and present in the palate. Lingering behind that is very subtle sweet traces of honey and fresh wood. The palate finished with a little burn at the tail end.","While the palate ends on a burn, the finish was something quite different. A strong lingering taste of ripe sweet peaches stays with you. The finish on this bourbon was much longer than I would have expected based on the age and it was real a treat.","2Bar Distillery is one of a number of small upstart distilleries located in Seattle. It’s the first distillery in Seattle, WA to make 100% local bourbon, meaning that the grains they source are local to Washington and Oregon State. 2Bar is trying to carve out a niche name for itself along with 100’s of other small start-up distilleries popping up around the US. I will say that it’s refreshing to see a distillery use local grains from a part of the US that is more commonly associated with craft beer production than with bourbon."," Like most new distilleries, this Bourbon from 2Bar is priced at a premium. While this may be coming from a young start-up distillery, it still plays in the same space with established players that have been producing bourbon for well over 100 years. At $50, there are many well-known bourbons that blow 2Bar out of the water and the same can be said at even the $35 or $40 price point. I realize they have to pay the upfront costs of the distillery while they age a more mature product, but it’s still hard to swallow paying $50 for just an average bourbon at best.","Great finish, but still needs a few more years in a barrel.","Thanks to the great sweet peach finish, I can easily see this bourbon transporting you to the middle of summer even if you’re drinking it in the dead of winter. However while the finish is great, it just doesn’t make up for the rest of this bourbon. Really, you’re dealing with a young bourbon that’s priced at a premium. It will be really interesting to see how this product unfolds after it’s had a lot more time to mature in the barrel. In the meantime, I’d recommend trying 2Bar Bourbon if you’re out at a bar, but hold off on buying a bottle until they’ve had more time to age their product.",Jordan,1,2,3.5,3,2,2,https://www.breakingbourbon.com/review/2bar-bourbon
,Basil Hayden's 10 Year Bourbon,Classification: Straight Bourbon,Company: Beam Suntory,Distillery: Jim Beam,Released: December 2018,Proof: 80,Age: 10 Years,"Mashbill: 63% Corn, 27% Rye, 10% Malted Barley",Color: Light Gold,MSRP: $60 (2019),Official Website,"Beam brings back an age stated version of Basil Hayden’s to the market with Basil Hayden’s 10 Year. Like the standard version, Basil Hayden’s 10 Year is created using Jim Beam’s high-rye mashbill that is found in Old Grand-Dad and Old Grand-Dad 114. This bottling will be a limited release that will return in limited quantities each holiday season. It is Basil Hayden's oldest release to date.","The nose brings doses of summer fruits and oak. Additionally, there’s a light hint of honeyed vanilla added to the mix. The aroma is less floral than I find standard Basil Hayden’s to be, with oak coming through more predominantly. Sadly, the low proof results in a lack of overall depth.","The palate continues to be light due to the 80 proof that Beam bottles this at. The good news is that this lower proof really allows you to roll the sip around in your mouth for a long time to try to pick out flavors. The bad news is that oak and sweet vanilla form the entirety of the palate, which isn’t what you’d expect from a 10 year old bourbon.","Like its younger sibling, Basil Hayden’s 10 Year’s finish is short and almost nonexistent, ending almost as soon as it starts. Light oak dominates with an ever-so-slight touch of sweetness. For a 10 year old bourbon the lack of depth is surprising and unfortunate.","It’s great to see Basil Hayden’s add an age stated bottle to their lineup. In 2014 Beam removed the 8 year age statement from Basil Hayden’s making it a no age statement (NAS) bottling, instead labelling it “Artfully Aged.” It’s now rumored to be bottled at around 6-7 years old. An extra few years would hopefully bring some needed definition to Basil Hayden’s flavor profile.

While I didn’t have an old 8 year old bottle of Basil Hayden’s to compare it against, I did compare it side by side with the standard NAS bottling. Surprisingly, all around the 10 year variant was lacking compared to the NAS bottle. It would have been great if Beam took this opportunity to also up the proof even if only 10 points to help enhance the sip. Instead you’re left with a bourbon that fades into an over-crowded field faster than you can blink an eye.","On its own a 10 year old bourbon for $60 isn’t completely out of line with today’s market pricing. However once you add in the fact that this bourbon is only 80 proof and delivers a completely underwhelming experience, the price tag now becomes concerning. While a limited release can usually justify a higher price tag, you have to actually deliver on the bourbon in the bottle. In this case Basil Hayden’s 10 Year falls way short. Yes it’s only about $15 more than a standard Basil Hayden’s bottle, but a 25% markup is just not able to be justified here.",The extra time in the barrel seems to have taken away whatever redeeming quality Basil Hayden’s had going for it.,"When it was announced that Basil Hayden’s was gaining an age statement in a limited release form my interest was quickly piqued. I was disappointed to see it still retained the low 80 proof point, yet I still held out hope that the extra time in the barrel would give a little extra depth to the standard Basil Hayden’s profile. In the end though, the exact opposite happened. The extra time in the barrel seems to have zapped away what little life Basil Hayden’s had going for it. While it’s not a flavor profile that will make you cringe, it’s instead just very one dimensional and almost non-existent at some points. This just goes to show that adding more time in the barrel along with an age statement isn’t always the magic bullet that consumers hope it will be.",Jordan,2,2,1.5,2,1.5,2,https://www.breakingbourbon.com/review/basil-haydens-10-year-bourbon
,Basil Hayden's Bourbon,Classification: Straight Bourbon,Company: Beam Suntory,Distillery: Jim Beam,Released: Ongoing,Proof: 80,Age: NAS,"Mashbill: 63% Corn, 27% Rye, 10% Malted Barley",Color: Light Gold,MSRP: $45 (2019),Official Website,"Basil Hayden’s Bourbon is one of four bourbons that comprise Jim Beam’s Small Batch Bourbon Collection. The others are Knob Creek, Baker’s Bourbon, and Booker’s Bourbon. Basil Hayden’s falls first in line proof-wise at 80 proof. While the other three bourbons in the Small Batch Collection all share the same mashbill of 77% corn, 13% rye, and 10% malted barley, Basil Hayden’s is created using Jim Beam’s high-rye mashbill that is found in Old Grand-Dad and Old Grand-Dad 114.

Basil Hayden’s is named after the late Master Distiller Basil Hayden Sr. who was known for his use of high rye bourbon mashbills.","Bright peaches and ripe mixed berries jump right out. Further hunting brings forth light traces of oak, orange zest, and a smidge of white pepper. The scents are on the lighter side overall due to the low proof, yet they’re still easy to identify and appreciate.","The palate is understandably light due to the 80 proof that Beam bottles this at. Light vanilla, new wood, and peaches mingle together and form the entirety of the palate. While the 80 proof makes this incredibly easy to sip, the mouthfeel is noticeably thin, and even at the bottling proof, this seems lighter than average. A few additional proof points would have gone a long way to deepen the palate.","The finish is short and almost nonexistent, and ends almost as soon as it starts. Oak, light summer fruits, and a touch of corn grain along with new leather are present, but only after really hunting to find them. It’s reminiscent of a really watered down whiskey, which many would argue at 80 proof, that this is all it really is.","Basil Hayden’s is different in many ways from the other bottles in the Small Batch Collection. Positioned as a premium gateway bourbon, it’s proofed a whole 20 points lower than its next lowest sibling, Knob Creek. Additionally, it uses a different mashbill than the rest. One trait it does share with Knob Creek and Booker’s Bourbon, is that it also lost its age statement (8 Year) in 2014. It’s rumored to be bottled at a higher age than Old Grand-Dad, but without an actual age statement it’s hard to trust much in that rumor.

The one saving grace is that the higher rye content does however give it a different and more easily approachable flavor profile than the rest of the Small Batch Collection, albeit even if it’s extremely weak. The assumption is that Beam is trying to appeal to new bourbon drinkers who are looking for a flashier looking bottle with a lower proof. While Basil Hayden’s may win on style points, there are plenty of other bourbons on the market that offer an approachable entry level experience at a much better price.","A slick bottle design and easy sip position Basil Hayden’s to be a good gateway bourbon, yet its MSRP is a still a head scratcher. The lowest proof in Beam’s Small Batch Collection, it carries quite a premium price tag for a non-age stated 80 proof bourbon. For a few dollars less you can get a fuller flavor Knob Creek or for about the same price, you can get a Knob Creek Single Barrel, which offers an exceptional value for what it delivers. Logical reasoning would go that Beam would hook people in with a easy to drink low proof bourbon at a lower price tag and get consumers to move up the value chain with higher proof bolder bourbons as their palates and curiosities expand. However, Beam takes the opposite approach with Basil Hayden’s pricing.

On top of that, if you love the Jim Beam high rye mash bill but want a higher proof, you can always pick up a bottle of Old Grand-Dad 114 for less. Yes, Old Grand-Dad is often overlooked on shelves due to its association as an old man’s bourbon, but that’s really a shame since the bourbon is just as approachable. Sure Basil Hayden’s comes in a bottle that conveys a much more premium product versus the Old Grand-Dad line, but a great bottle design shouldn’t equate to an inflated MSRP.","The gateway bourbon of the Small Batch Collection, Basil Hayden’s falls short where it counts.","Basil Hayden’s is a gateway bourbon for many, myself included. When I first started my bourbon journey while living in Kentucky, I wanted something easy to drink and also something that stood out amongst the rest of the bottles on the shelf. Enter Basil Hayden’s. An approachable bourbon that had a bottle that looked completely different than the rest and conveyed a feeling of a premium product.
Fast forward over a decade, and while Basil Hayden’s still stands out, it doesn’t shine as bright as it used to. Part of this is the fact that bourbon bottle design has really come a long way as distilleries up their marketing game, but more so is the fact that Basil Hayden’s just doesn’t deliver a solid pour. The lighter flavor profile starts strong but quickly fades as you work your way through the sip. Additionally, its over inflated price tag, along with its loss of an age statement makes this a much harder bourbon to recommend these days. Nostalgia will always allow me to hold a soft spot in my heart for Basil Hayden’s, but like many nostalgic things in life, it’s sometimes best to leave them to memory versus trying to recapture that initial magic.",Jordan,2.5,2,1.5,2,1.5,2,https://www.breakingbourbon.com/review/basil-haydens-bourbon
,Basil Hayden's Two by Two Rye,Classification: Blend of Straight Bourbon & Straight Rye Whiskey,Company: Beam Suntory,Distillery: Jim Beam,Released: July 2018,Proof: 80,Age: NAS (Blend of 5 and 7 year old ryes plus 6 and 13 year old bourbons),Mashbill: Undisclosed,Color: Gold,MSRP: $45 (2018),Official Website,"Basil Hayden’s Two by Two Rye is the third release in the limited edition Basil Hayden’s rye line following Basil Hayden’s Rye Whiskey and Basil Hayden’s Dark Rye. Two by Two Rye is a blend of two Kentucky straight rye whiskeys and two Kentucky straight bourbon whiskeys. While no mashbill or blend percentage is given, Beam Suntory did state that the blend consists of a 5 year old Kentucky straight rye, a 7 year old “high-rye” Kentucky straight rye, a 13 year old Kentucky straight bourbon, and a 6 year old Kentucky straight bourbon.","Oak, rye spice, and banana are the predominant scents with brown sugar and vanilla lingering underneath. Unfortunately, the low proof of Two by Two Rye really makes you work to find the scents. The aromas aren’t bad individually, but the way they come together makes them seem more muddled than defined which brings down the whole experience.","A touch of sweetness along with oak are the predominant flavors in the sip. In addition, it contains light traces of vanilla, bubble gum, and unsalted peanut butter. I was also surprised to see a lack of any rye influence in the sip. The good news is that the low proof allows you to swirl this around to hunt out flavors. The bad news is that the flavors that are present aren’t worth hunting out. Overall the palate seems more jumbled than not.","Slightly tannic, the first descriptor that pops into my head is mushy oak. The finish is dry, with none of the sweetness from the nose or palate present. In addition to prominent oak, traces of dry leather and the faintest hint of dry nuts are mixed in. The flavors fade quickly and leave a dry coating of stale oak that lingers far too long.","It was only a few short years ago that bourbon rye blends came to market. Some with a “tale” of how they were accidentally blended such as the first release of Wild Turkey’s Forgiven, others such as High West Bourye that were done on purpose. Nowadays it’s getting more common to see bourbon rye blends on the market, each with their own twist. Wild Turkey’s Forgiven contained one rye and one bourbon, and High West Bourye contained four blended whiskeys, three of them were rye and one was a bourbon. With Two by Two Rye, Beam slightly changes that formula to two ryes and two bourbons without providing detailed information on those mashbills or blend percentages.

In this case while the resulting flavor profile is far from unique, the blend they decided to go with is at least new. Credit should be given for being innovative and trying something new, although it does beg one to wonder why stop at two by two, why not three by three or four by four? Maybe that will be a 2019 trend, but I digress. With Two by Two Rye, you would hope that a unique blend came with a unique flavor profile. Unfortunately from start to finish the experience seems muddled and doesn’t quite come together.","From a purley blended rye standpoint, it’s certainly much cheaper than the two closest yet not quite equal bottles on the market, which would be High West Bourye and Jefferson’s Chef’s Collaboration. However in terms of flavor I still walk away feeling like I paid much too much for the sip that is delivered by this blend. It comes across as more haphazard than refined and drives home the point that just because a limited release may be priced low in comparison to the rest of the market, doesn’t mean that you’re getting a good value for your money.","Two by Two Rye proves that sometimes what’s good in theory, isn’t always good in execution.","I’m all for innovation in the whiskey world. Some of my favorite pours have been barrel finished products such as Angel’s Envy Rye or or those products that try something new for innovation’s sake such as Wigle’s Quaker Strength. Often these types of products draw strong opinions from consumers, as can be seen with the discussions around 2017’s Basil Hayden’s Dark Rye. I found Dark Rye to be different with the ability to deliver a really unique drinkable pour at an affordable price.

Unfortunately Two by Two Rye doesn’t deliver that same experience. Seeing as Beam went to the trouble of picking out four distinct whiskeys to put into this blend, I was expecting more. Instead Two by Two Rye’s flavors all seem more muddled than defined, and the low proof of the Basil Hayden’s line delivers an overall subpar drinking experience. Credit to Beam for trying, but this is one pour I recommend seeking out trying before you spend your money on a bottle.",Jordan,2,2,1.5,2,2,2,https://www.breakingbourbon.com/review/basil-hydens-two-by-two-rye
,Basil Hayden’s Rye 10 Year,Classification: Straight Rye,Company: Beam Suntory,Distillery: Jim Beam,Release Date: May 2020,Proof: 80,Age:10 Years,Mashbill: Undisclosed,Color: Light Gold,MSRP: $70 (2020),Official Website,"Basil Hayden’s is one of four whiskeys that comprise Jim Beam’s Small Batch Collection. The others are Knob Creek, Baker’s Bourbon, and Booker’s Bourbon. Basil Hayden’s falls first in line proof-wise at 80 proof. Basil Hayden’s is named after the late Master Distiller Basil Hayden Sr. who was known for his use of high rye bourbon mashbills.

Basil Hayden’s Rye 10 Year is the fifth release in the Basil Hayden’s rye line. This release is the oldest rye and the first age stated rye that has been released under the Basil Hayden’s brand.","A light array of flavors greets you as you bring the glass to your nose. Light oak and vanilla are prominent, with a slight hint of peanuts and bananas foster in the background when you inhale a little deeper. The 80 proof is evident here as all of the scents, while fine, are more mellow than you’d like them to be.","The lightness in the nose carries over to the palate. It’s extremely thin with a slight sweet hint of oak and vanilla gingerly making an appearance. If you press really hard, you get a slight bit of white peppercorn heat, but the whiskey makes you work for it. The combination isn’t bad, more so it’s just forgettable. I’d be hard-pressed to guess that this is a rye, let alone an aged rye had I not poured the whiskey into the glass myself.","A very subtle pop of rye spice starts off the finish along with sweet vanilla and light oak. The spice and oak linger for a short bit which thankfully helps to make up for the lack of overall depth found in the finish. On the very tail end there is a small hint of peanut as the flavors fade away. It’s a forgettable way to end the sip, which at this point doesn’t come as much of a surprise.","Beam isn’t best known for their rye whiskey capabilities. Sure they’ve had their hits like the one-off phenomenal Booker’s Rye, but for the most part they stay relatively quiet on this front. The only two ongoing ryes the company makes are Jim Beam Rye and Knob Creek Rye, with  neither leaving you with a very memorable experience.

Age stated ryes aren’t as common as their bourbon counterparts, and that holds especially true for double digit age statements. The last time Beam put an age statement on a rye was for its Booker’s Rye which was 13 years old. For that release, the extra time in the barrel and the high proof paid off in spades. Instead of following in its big brother’s steps, Basil Hayden’s Rye 10 Year seems to have run off in the opposite direction.

Other aged ryes on the market such as Pinhook’s Rye Series,  Pikesville Rye 6 Year, Russell Reserve 6 Year Rye, and Michter’s 10 Year Rye, all have one thing in common - proof. Ryes tend to start to pop when you reach about 90 proof. Anything less and the spice and other flavors that the rye grain imparts tend to start to lose a lot of their boldness. Anyone can slap an age statement on a rye, but you also have to make sure that the contents inside live up to it. It’s not that this is an abhorrent abomination, instead there just isn’t anything memorable about Basil Hayden’s Rye 10 Year besides the number 10 on the outside of the bottle.","Not only is this the oldest rye to date released under the Basil Hayden’s name, it is also the most expensive release up to this point too. The official MSRP is a head scratching $70. While aged ryes are not very common, they’re not necessarily unicorns either. Additionally, they’re usually higher proofed vs. the 80 proof that this rye is. No matter how you cut it, for the sip Basil Hayden’s Rye 10 Year delivers, it's incredibly overpriced.","A rare age-stated rye from Jim Beam, Basil Hayden’s Rye 10 Year is a good reminder that age doesn’t always equate to a better sip.","Over the last few years, Beam has tried expanding Basil Hayden’s into the rye market. Half of the expressions so far have been regular ryes like Basil Hayden’s Rye or Basil Hayden’s Two By Two Rye, while the other half have blended ryes in the form of Basil Hayden’s Caribbean Reserve Rye or Basil Hayden’s Dark Rye. While their blended ryes have been slightly more memorable so far, to date, the Basil Hayden’s Rye brand has missed the mark. I was hopeful that adding an age statement might finally allow Basil Hayden’s Rye to be the rye it wants to be, but this still isn’t the case.

It may carry a double-digit age statement, but what it seems to be lacking is any soul. Its bland flavor, due in large part to its low proof, just zaps any pizzazz that Basil Hayden’s Rye 10 Year may have had. And that’s really the main issue that has happened with a lot of the Basil Hayden’s releases in recent years. The low 80 proof robs the brand of its potential. I understand that they want to target consumers who are seeking out a lower proof poor in a high- end looking bottle, however if the whiskey inside tastes bland, what’s the point?

One day the Basil Hayden’s may find a way to make their core bourbon and rye whiskeys stand out without having to blend them with other spirits. For now, Basil Hayden’s Rye 10 Year carries on with the slightly lackluster family badge that its siblings before have worn.",Jordan,2.5,1.5,2,3,1.5,2,https://www.breakingbourbon.com/review/basil-haydens-rye-10-year
,Black Maple Hill,Classification: Straight Bourbon,Company: CVI Brands,Distillery: Unconfirmed,Released: 2013,Proof: 95,Age: NAS (Rumored 8 years),,Color:  Golden Amber,MSRP: $45 (2014),Official Website,,"Black Maple Hill has a wonderful, trusting nose on it. The big orange citrus opening welcomes all. Hints of corn and honey develop as more air mixes with the bourbon. Traces of oak and spice hide in the background. Deliciously sweet aroma.","And then,  you taste it. The sweet nose completely disappears, and a very dry corn flavor takes over. It’s quite shocking how different the nose and palate are from each other. It was something I wasn’t expecting, and that’s not necessarily a good thing in this case. Some rye spice develops on the mid to heavy back end.","The 95 proof makes Black Maple Hill an easy bourbon to sip. Very little heat allows the bourbon to make its mark without the burn. The flavor is not complex like a Pappy, making that common comparison between the two seem unfair. There aren’t a lot of fireworks with this one. The oak and rye dominate. The finish gets to the point quickly and doesn’t linger too long. Surprisingly, traces of alcohol flavor become more prominent as air mixes with the bourbon and overshadow much of what this bourbon had going for it.","This is easily one of the “hot” bourbon finds of the last few years. Much of this started in the early 2000’s as the Lawrenceburg Black Maple Hill were bottled by ""Pappy"" Van Winkle. The older, age-stamped Black Maple Hill bourbon and ryes have become legendary even in that short amount of time. That hype has spilled over to the non-Van Winkle producing NAS orange label bottles of Black Maple Hill making them even hard to find. The question is, “is the orange label deserving of hype?” What we have is a rumored 8 year bourbon from a non-distiller producer who’s barrel origin is not disclosed. We don’t even know the quantity of CVI Brand’s output, so one bottle could be different from the next as they source from different producers as one “batch” runs out. Black Maple Hill is a straight-up bourbon that has it’s own specific flavor like any good brand has., but is it special? Not really.","If you remove the hype and take Black Maple Hill for what it is, it has a hard time standing up to other $40 bourbons. It certainly has an interesting flavor that separates itself from other bourbons in its price range, but here is a case where interesting doesn’t always mean better. It’s an OK bourbon that’s priced a little on the high side. Don’t get caught up in the hype, Black Maple Hill isn’t worth the inflated prices people are selling it for on the after-market.","Interesting nose, boring finish, over-hyped","The first few times I had Black Maple Hill I flat-out hated it. It was in my top five of most hated bourbons. As I sipped it again for this review, I’m found more things to like about it. It has an extremely pleasant nose but the palate and finish just can’t match the bar the nose sets. Black Maple Hill is interesting, but the stark contrast from the sweet nose to the dry palate, to a developing alcohol flavor despite its low proof, make Black Maple Hill a pass in my book.",Eric,4,2,2,2,2,2,https://www.breakingbourbon.com/review/black-maple-hill
,Blanton's Special Reserve,Classification: Straight Bourbon,"Company: Sazerac Conapny Inc., Blanton's Distilling Company",Distillery: Buffalo Trace,Released: Ongoing,Proof: 80,Age: NAS,Mashbill: Undisclosed,Color:  Honey,MSRP: $48 (2016),Official Website,This barrel of Blanton's Special Reserve was dumped on 8-21-13 from Barrel No. 311. It was stored in Warehouse H on Rick No. 22. The registered Bottle No. is 105. It is currently only offered in international markets and in some domestic duty free stores. This bourbon was bottled specially for sale in the U.K. and is only sold in 700ml bottles.,"The nose can best be summed up as really light. Light traces of grain, hay, new wood and citrus are present along with hints of dried fruit. While pleasant, it’s definitely weaker than the Original Single Barrel Blanton’s nose, which I normally find quite delicious and have a hard time pulling away from. Nothing really jumps out that makes me want to continue to nose this bourbon like I normally would with a glass of Original Blanton’s.","The first thing I notice when tasting this bourbon is a watered down slightly sweet palate. Traces of honey, citrus, vanilla, and a faint hint of pepper were noticeable. While pleasant it isn’t very complex and the flavors seemed to disappear before I even finish swallowing a sip.","While relatively short on this edition of Blanton’s, the finish is much more present then the nose and palate. Traces of new wood are present, along with rye, a hint of leather, and what can best be described as fresh cut grass - the defining flavor that stayed with me until the finish dissipated.","This is a really interesting bourbon in terms of uniqueness. It’s clearly aimed at individuals who don’t like high proof bourbons or are just starting to drink bourbon. For all practical purposes, you’re getting a watered down version of the Original Blanton’s Single Barrel. One that is only sold overseas to boot.

However just because it’s only sold outside of the US, doesn’t automatically make it inherently special. Sure you may impress a few bourbon enthusiasts by buying a bottle that isn’t readily available until they realize that they have access to a version of Blanton’s that’s head and shoulders better than Blanton’s Special Reserve. When drinking this bourbon I kept thinking that the soul of Blanton’s seemed to be missing. Gone were the intense delicious flavors found in the Original Single Barrel Blanton’s, and instead I felt someone had slipped one to many ice cubes in my Blanton’s and watered it down just a tad too much.","While this may be a unique bourbon only in the sense that you can’t normally buy it in the US, the price of admission just isn’t worth it in my book. Coming in at almost $50, it’s selling at the same price as a bottle of Blanton’s Original Single Barrel. Seeing as this bourbon was slightly below average when it came to the nose, palate, and finish, it’s really hard to justify the price for the Special Reserve version.","A fun novelty to try a glass if you get a chance, but save your money to buy one of the other international versions - either Blanton's Gold or Blanton's Straight from the Barrel.","At just 80 proof, I can see how this would be a great line extension to introduce people to the Blanton's brand…if it sold for about $20 less. I understand the concept is to sell this in foreign markets where the average consumer may prefer a lower proof bourbon. That being said, Blanton’s Original Single Barrel at 93 proof is only 13 proof higher, but boy does that extra bit of proof make a world of difference. And while I could see this being a great bourbon to use to make cocktails, it’s hard to justify doing so at almost $50 a bottle.

Interestingly enough, the Blanton’s website recommends that this is best served on ice or in a cocktail. While I didn’t mix a cocktail with this, I did add an ice cube after my tasting to see why they recommended this method. I have to say that an ice cube utterly destroyed any light flavors in the palate and made the nose almost nonexistent. Even for a new bourbon drinker, I’d highly recommend not adding ice to this bourbon!",Jordan,2,2,2,2,1.5,2,https://www.breakingbourbon.com/review/blantons-special-reserve
,Cedar Ridge Iowa Bourbon Whiskey,Classification: Bourbon,Company: Cedar Ridge Vineyards,Distillery: Cedar Ridge Distillery,Released: Ongoing,Proof: 100*,Age: NAS,"Mashbill: 75% Corn, 15% Malted Barley, 10% Rye",Color: Golden Raisin,MSRP: $40,Official Website,"Cedar Ridge Distillery was founded in 2005 and was the first licensed distillery in Iowa since Prohibition. The distillery initially produced wine and a number of other spirits before producing whiskey. Cedar Ridge Distillery launched their first bourbon in 2010 to pay homage to the fact that Iowa is the largest corn producing state in the Union.

*Their small batch Iowa Bourbon is normally bottled at 80 proof. In addition single barrel barrel proof versions can often be found ranging up to 115 proof. This small batch sample provided to us from Cedar Ridge was bottled at a slightly higher 100 proof.","Lots of corn, grain, and new oak. There’s a tingling of ethanol that makes its presence known, but not enough to be to unpleasant. While this is aged for a minimum of four years, it comes off as a whiskey that hasn’t spent a ton of time in the barrel due to the lack of depth displayed in its weak nose.","Corn, light vanilla, fruit jam, a hint of pear, and oak. The palate is more interesting than the nose, however all of the flavors present are very light and you really have to hunt them out. The ethanol that was clearly present in the nose isn’t present, and this bourbon ends up drinking lower than the 100 proof it clocks in at.","White pepper, light fruits, vanilla, and fresh wood are all present at the start of the finish. These notes then fade away to just the white pepper and fresh wood, which linger for a short period. It’s simple, short, and leaves an unmemorable impression.","As we pointed out in our 2016 The Year in Bourbon article, more and more bourbons from upstart distillers arrive on the market every year. Cedar Ridge’s whiskeys have the distinction of being produced in Iowa, using Iowa raised corn, and from the first licensed distillery in the state since Prohibition. However since it first opened, there are now eight other whiskey distilleries that operate in the state.

What’s unique about this specific bourbon is that it was bottled 20 proof points higher than the standard 80 proof version you can find in stores. While I always prefer to taste bourbons around 95-115 proof range - since I find more flavor usually shines through - this version of Cedar Ridge is lacking in distinguishing flavor characteristics that I was expecting to find. It really makes me wonder why Cedar Ridge chose to settle on 80 proof for their wide release.","As is often the case when reviewing a bourbon from a new distillery, you’re paying a premium as the distillery tries to establish itself. I pointed this out in my review of 2Bar Bourbon from Seattle and OYOfrom Columbus, and the same can be said for this bourbon. At $40, this is priced slightly less than the $50 price tag you see from many other young distilleries. That said, that doesn’t mean it represents a good value for the bourbon found inside the bottle. For example, the Big Bottom Single Barrel I reviewed was also priced at $40 and offers a much deeper and tastier drinking experience. In this case, $40 is a lot to pay for a bourbon that tastes much younger than it really is.","Youthful in appearance and in taste, this bourbon doesn’t do much to stand out from the crowded space it plays in.","Even though this is aged a minimum of four years in 53 gallon barrels, this bourbon exhibits an extreme youth that tends to show from its color all the way through the actual whiskey in the glass. The flavors present are characteristically youthful, however don’t mistake youthful for bad either. While it’s certainly below my standard for a $40 bourbon, it’s also better than the products coming out of other young distilleries such as Cleveland Whiskey, for example. There are a lot of other distilleries releasing bourbon and unfortunately, this release of Iowa Bourbon doesn’t stand out enough from the rest of the crowd.

With Iowa’s cold winters, hot summers, and abundance of corn at its disposal, Cedar Ridge has all of the ingredients necessary to try to fine tune a memorable small batch bourbon from its rickhouses. They have started to release higher aged bourbons such as their Reserve Bourbon which is aged five years. It will be interesting revisit their Iowa Bourbon Whiskey over time as they’re able to increase the average age of the bourbon used.

The sample used for this review was provided at no cost courtesy of Cedar Ridge. We thank them for allowing us to review it with no strings attached.",Jordan,2,2.5,2,2.5,2,2,https://www.breakingbourbon.com/review/cedar-ridge-iowa-bourbon-whiskey
,Coopers' Craft,Classification: Straight Bourbon,Company: Brown-Forman,Distillery: Brown-Forman Distillery,Released: Ongoing,Proof: 82.2,Age: NAS (Aged 4-6 years),Mashbill: Undisclosed,Color: Light Amber,MSRP: $29 (2017),Official Website,"Brown-Forman is the only major whiskey maker with its own cooperages. To recognize the cooperages’ contributions to Brown-Forman, the company released Coopers’ Craft Bourbon in honor of them. It is the first new bourbon brand that Brown-Forman has added to its permanent lineup in 20 years since Woodford Reserve.

According to Brown-Form, Coopers’ Craft is made from a slightly different mashbill than Old Forester, with it having a slightly more corn and slightly less rye composition than Old Forester. Brown-Forman states that Coopers’ Craft uses a special beech and birch charcoal filter finishing process. According to Brown-Forman spokeswoman Andrea Duvall, after the bourbon has aged four to six years, its filtering gives it extra smoothness and oakiness.","A youthful nose of corn, ripened bananas, lightly toasted oak, and whiffs of grain. These delicate notes don’t carry much depth, and what’s presented up front is all you get. While the nose probably won’t turn anyone off, I highly doubt it will win over any big fans either.","This is a straightforward and easy to drink whiskey. Simplicity is the name of the game with this bourbon, both in it’s thin mouthfeel and simple flavors. Corn, oak, orange rinds, and light hints of green pepper are all present but none dominates the flavor profile.","The finish is mellow with very little heat throughout. Vanilla, leather, and toasted oak are present. The initial sweetness quickly morphs to a dry oaky finish that lingers for a while and ever so slightly overextends its stay.","A big claim of this bourbon is its unique filtration process. The beech and birch charcoal filter definitely imparts a noticeable layer of toasted oak to the flavor profile. That said, it doesn’t do anything to overcome the youthfulness of the bourbon, even though it’s a blend of four to six year old bourbons. What ultimately is presented, is a subpar bourbon that isn’t able to stand out from the crowded space it’s playing in and is easily forgotten.","With the bourbon market red hot and more products hitting the market at higher and higher prices every day, it feels like it should be easy to celebrate a bourbon that costs under $30. The problem is, Coopers’ Craft brings nothing new to the table, and doesn’t have much to offer. Due to its low proof and lack of a strong flavor profile, this isn’t ideal as a sipping bourbon, and at best would be used in a cocktail and more likely in a mixed drink. There are multiple bourbons I’d recommend for $30 or less that deliver a fuller flavor profile. Honestly, I’m surprised it’s priced so closely to Woodford Reserve. While Woodford doesn’t really break any new grounds, it still delivers a slightly better tasting experience.","Unfortunately forgettable, this is one tribute bourbon that’s not worth seeking out.","It’s surprising to see the flavor profile that Brown-Forman chose for its first new permanent bourbon brand in 20 years. While I never go into a review expecting to be wowed, I did have higher expectations for this to be better than it is, especially since it shares a mashbill similar to Old Forester. In actuality, I walked away from my time with this bourbon confused and disappointed. The end result is a lackluster and quickly forgettable bourbon that’s at a price that’s higher than it should be for what it is. And it’s not that Brown-Forman can’t produce good new whiskey either. Their Old Forester Whiskey Row series seems to get progressively better with each release.

Coopers’ Craft feels like it should have potential, but in the end, it just never lives up to the expectations its older siblings in the Brown-Forman family have set. For the price, there are bourbons that provide a more complex and flavorful sip, or would provide a better base for a great cocktail. Additionally, while this would mix well, there are other bourbons on the market that sell for a lot less that would work just as well with soda. Due to all of this, this is one bottle that may end up sitting on my shelf for a long time to come.",Jordan,2,2,2,2.5,1.5,2,https://www.breakingbourbon.com/review/coopers-craft
,Crown Royal Bourbon Mash (Blenders' Mash),Classification: Blended Canadian Whiskey,Company: Diageo,Distillery: Crown Royal Gimli Distillery,Released: March 2018 (Ongoing),Proof: 80,Age: NAS,"Mashbill: 64% Corn, 31.5% Rye, 4.5% Malted Barley",Color: Medium Mahogany,MSRP: $30 (2018),Official Website,"Crown Royal Bourbon Mash is part of the company's “The Blenders’ Series” line of whiskeys. The whiskey created controversy due to it being called “Bourbon Mash” as its a blended Canadian whiskey. While it technically utilizes a bourbon mashbill, it is produced in Canada and also utilizes a blend of new oak barrels and used barrels. The TTB initially approved the label (COLA) for this product, only to later revoke this approval after the product had already gone to market. Realizing their error, the TTB granted Diageo a one year time frame to continue using the Bourbon Mash naming convention for this product.

In the aftermath, Diageo moved quickly to correct its labeling mistake. While initial batches made no distinction that anything was out of place with the product, later batches have a large sticker placed on both the outside of the box and on the bottle itself that reads “THIS IS NOT A BOURBON WHISKEY.” Additionally, Diageo jettisoned the “Bourbon Mash” name immediately  instead of taking the full year it was allotted, and renamed it Blenders’ Mash a few short months after Bourbon Mash hit the market.

The whiskey being reviewed is from bottle number 0195470.","The nose is pleasant and surprisingly lush. Fruit notes dominate with green apple, peaches, pears, and white grapes mingling together. Extremely light notes of vanilla and hay hide in the background.","Immediately upon taking a sip my mouth is hit with a noticeably dry note. The lush fruits that were prominent on the nose are now muddled and mixed with soggy oak, dry leather, and bunked vanilla. The good news is that the low proof allows the whiskey to be swished around  my mouth to hunt out additional flavors. The bad news is the ones that are there are very muted and hard to find. Ultimately the sip delivers a weaker than expected experience.","The muddled flavors from the palate carry through to the finish. It starts with a heavy dose of dry leather and oak, which are present from the start and last until the end. In between, hints of apple, peaches and vanilla waft in, but they’re light and fleeting. Overall it’s a weaker finish that ends the sip on a disappointing note.","This one will go down in the books as a head scratcher. As in, what was the TTB thinking when they approved this COLA? It begs the question, did this slip by the reviewer or does the TTB not even know their own rules? Either way, give Diageo credit for creating the first Canadian bourbon mash.

From a whiskey standpoint though, the product itself is a disgrace to the bourbon name, even if it wasn’t technically legal. If you’re going to release a bourbon mash version of your flagship product at least try to bring some of the good with it. While I don’t claim to be a regular Crown Royal drinker, I do always have a bottle on hand for my guests who are fans of the brand and Canadian whiskey overall. When comparing Bourbon Mash against the standard product, the nose delivers an ever-so-slightly elevated experience, however the rest of the sip lacks in comparison and doesn’t contain the usual carmely rye notes. I’m not saying that Diageo needed to create a knock-your-socks-off “bourbon,” but if you’re going to add the word bourbon label, at least do some justice to the national spirit of your neighbors down south and make it taste half decent!","As far as a unique collection piece goes, $30 is about as cheap as it comes. You have the chance to own a one-off Canadian “bourbon-that’s-not-really-a-bourbon” whiskey, for an incredibly low price. It’s a talking piece that will be sure to draw conversation among whiskey enthusiasts. Unfortunately, even at this low price, the actual whiskey inside of the bottle isn’t worth drinking. It’s about $10 overpriced, and that may be generous.",Crown Royal Bourbon Mash misses the mark in more ways than just its name.,"Going into this review, I really wanted to like this whiskey. Here was a chance for a foreign distiller to show that something similar to a bourbon whiskey can be produced outside of the U.S. and compete with the other leading brands on the market. The sparkling wine versus champagne tale; but instead with the bourbon name. In the end, this just wasn’t meant to be. Even with a new name being applied, I walked away from this experience wondering what Diageo was thinking.
‍
The standard Crown Royal is serviceable and is pleasant enough from time to time. Crown Royal Bourbon Mash is a standout alright, but for all the wrong reasons. If only the rest of the drinking experience could at least match its average nose. Instead the muddled weak flavors found in the palate carries through the entire experience right down to the fact that this cost me $30. I’m all for exploration, but in this case, it just goes to show that sometimes it’s best to stick with what you know. Hopefully Diageo takes note of this in the future.",Jordan,2.5,2,2,1.5,2,2,https://www.breakingbourbon.com/review/crown-royal-bourbon-mash-blenders-mash

Corn, caramel, leather and oak are immediately known. The caramel adds a good deal of sweetness to the nose. Quite pleasant.","Despite the nose giving off a sweet scent, very little of the palate reciprocates it. The bourbon’s medium bodied palate is surprisingly lacking. Spice, cinnamon and wood are the most prevalent of flavors, overpowering any amount of sweetness that tries to come through at first sip.",Whatever flavors develop in its palate quickly fall off the map during the bourbon’s finish. It has one of the shortest finishes I’ve had. It’s also surprisingly quite dry for such a sweet smelling bourbon. One thing it does have going for it is that it’s a smooth 99 proof pour. The bourbon goes down smooth and is easy to drink. Ezra B isn't an unpleasant experience but is quickly forgettable.,Ezra B Single Barrel has an amazing nose on it. It’s easily above average. Its palate and finish simply fall flat. It finishes so quickly that it’s hard to even have time to be unique. The bottle design with its use of blue wax and ribbon may be the most unique aspect of this bourbon - if you’re into that sort of thing.,"Depending on where you live, this bourbon has quite the range in price. Being a 12 year at 99 proof and under $35, it’s not a bad value until you compare it to other bourbons in its class. Compared to the benchmark of $30 range bourbons, Four Roses Single Barrel, it doesn’t come close. Under $30 is the price range this bourbon should be bought at.","Starts high, ends flat.","This is a bourbon that starts off great but quickly goes downhill. Its beautiful sweet nose is rendered obsolete by the time you arrive at the bourbon’s dry finish. There’s nothing inherently bad about this bourbon, it just falls short of being anything meaningful and memorable. It’s a descending ride to boresville.",Eric,4,2.5,1.5,2.5,2.5,2,https://www.breakingbourbon.com/review/ezra-b-12-year-single-barrel
In Depth Review,High West Bourye 2015 Release,Bourbon/Rye Blend,High West,Sourced from MGP/LDI/Seagrams Indiana and Barton Distillery,January 2015,92,complex blend of four different mashbills with undisclosed ratios,complex blend of four different mashbills with undisclosed ratios,Dark Amber,$80 (2015),,,"The nose can best be summed up as organic: dew covered grass, fresh oak, and light evergreen are all present. There’s very little alcohol presence that’s noticeable sans a slight tingling at the end of each whiff. It’s not bad, but for such a complex mingling of whiskey’s, it’s not at all memorable either.","For a blend of bourbon and ryes of varying age I was expecting a complex palate. Instead I’m greeted with something that while enjoyable, is pretty straightforward and plain. The palate is a solid balanced mix of sweet and spicy. The honey and vanilla from the bourbon blend nicely with the peppery heat from the rye. Unfortunately these flavors dominate the whole palate and leave no room for the possibility of any subtle flavors to come through.","While the palate is simple and straightforward, the finish is slightly more complex. Leather and wood are present upfront and stay with you throughout the length of the finish. Additionally a high heat stays on my tongue from the beginning through the middle of the finish and then abruptly stops. It’s a shame since I was hoping the finish would morph into something more than it did versus the sudden drop off that’s experienced instead.","There aren’t too many bourbon-rye blends on the market outside of what High West is putting out with Bourye and Son of Bourye, with only Wild Turkey’s Forgiven & Jefferson’s Chef Collaboration coming to mind. Compared to Son of Bourye, Bourye’s palate pops more with the intensity of the sweet and spicy profile being much bolder. The finish is also slightly more complex and the added high heat is a nice touch in comparison. That being said, it’s still a simple flavor profile overall for such a complex blended whiskey. While the flavor profile isn’t one that will blow you away, credit should be given to High West for bringing a product like this to the market. In an industry that’s focused on experimenting with different grains and barrel finishes, it’s nice to see some innovation on the blending side of things. Many distilleries blend their ryes or bourbons when creating a batch of whiskey, in fact this is true for all whiskeys sans single barrel products, however blending together a bourbon with different rye recipes from multiple distilleries and different high ages is not very common. Innovation on the blending front is a breath of fresh air, and I wish other distilleries would try something similar in the future.

","While whiskey pricing across the board has been increasing steadily over the past few years, $80 is still considered a premium priced whiskey in the marketplace today. High West chose to use high aged distillates in Bourye when they easily could have gone the route of using lower aged, inexpensive whiskeys and created the same simple flavor profile. Unfortunately, they're trying to charge a price that they feel is in line with the various ryes and bourbon they used while producing a product that’s hard to justify as premium. Bourye is double the price of High West's other multi-style-whiskey blend Son of Bourye, with only marginal improvement over it. Realistically Bourye is more along the line of a $40 whiskey, and this is only to fairly compensate High West for the additional cost of the higher aged whiskeys they use in the blend. At $80 a bottle, and the highest priced bottle of common bourbon-rye blends on the market, I would expect a more complex flavor profile that would justify the price. Instead you’re presented with an overly simple, straightforward flavor profile with Bourye.

",A blend consisting of a nice pedigree of aged whiskeys that just delivers too mundane of an experience for the price.,"The unique blending recipe of Bourye is a very contrasting experience. On one hand it takes a lot of skill to select higher aged bourbon and ryes and blend them nicely so that only the peaks of sweet and spicy are present without any wood taste at all. On the other hand though, High West uses a nice range of higher aged bourbon and ryes in this blend that should in theory wow the drinker more than they do in all aspects of it’s flavor profile. While the ratio isn’t provided, I was expecting Bourye to contain a wide range of flavors that highlighted the best parts of each of the whiskeys used. Instead I walked away disappointed from such a straightforward experience. Throughout my time reviewing Bourye, I kept going back to one word: Simple. The fact is, Bourye is just too simple of an end product. High West is a distillery that’s known for being able to blend aged whiskeys with really good results. Bourye had potential to be great if only more of the unique attributes of each of the parts it consists of where highlighted. And while some could argue that at least they tried, for $80 a bottle I expect more than just a trying effort.

,I.W. Harper,Classification: Straight Bourbon,Company: Diageo/I.W. Harper Distilling Co.,Distillery: Sourced,Released: March 2015 / Ongoing,Proof: 82,Age: NAS,"Mashbill: 73% Corn, 18% Rye, 9% Malted Barley",Color:  Deep Gold,MSRP: $35 (2017),Official Website,"I.W. is a brand that has been around in some form since 1872. Originally launched by Isaac Wolfe Bernheim, the brand is now owned and operated by Diageo. While the brand has been sold since 1872, it hasn’t been sold in the US for the last 20 years, instead only being offered in the international marketplace during this time. Diageo choose to bring it back to the domestic marketplace in both a NAS bourbon and a 15 year age stated bourbon.

While the 15 year aged version is stated to to have been distilled at the New Bernheim Distillery, the source of the NAS bourbon is not being released. The bourbon was aged at their Stitzel-Weller Distillery warehouses and bottled at Diageo’s Tullahoma, Tennessee facility.","The nose is light and airy without a lot of standout flavors, which is to be expected from such a low proof bourbon. Traces of light vanilla, corn, fresh cork, and new oak are all present. The nose comes across as really young and makes me think that they’re using a bourbon not a day older than 4 years old, which is the bare minimum to be labeled straight bourbon without an age statement. Not a hint of alcohol is found on the nose which isn’t surprising for an 82 proof bourbon.","Taking my first sip, I immediately notice how sweet of a flavor profile Diageo imparted on the reincarnation of this brand. Honey, elderflower, vanilla, and toasted sugar are noticeable upfront. Additionally I notice that slight corky-ness that was on the nose in the palate too.

The palate isn’t bad per se, however it’s just not very complex. I would really like to see what this bourbon tastes like at a 100 proof or higher since I feel a lot more complexity would be revealed. Again the seemingly youngness of this bourbon comes to mind when tasting it.","Much like the palate, the finish lacks in complexity. I’m immediately hit with a big burst of juicy Georgia peaches upfront that’s mixed with lightly dried raisins and vanilla. The finish ends on a very short light leather and oak note. The shortness of this finish is something that really surprised me. While I really like the immediate taste of peaches, the flavor only lasts for a few seconds before morphing into the leather and oak, and peters out altogether within about 30 seconds. I do wish it would have lasted a little longer, because it’s pretty tasty for the moments when it’s present.","The rich history of Isaac Wolfe Bernheim and the Bernheim Brothers distillery is fascinating to read about, and I.W. Harper is an iconic brand in the sense of its longevity. While it hasn’t been sold in the US for almost 20 years, the brand has lived on globally in its domestic absence. It’s neat to see a brand that’s been around for over a 140 years being sold again in the US.

All this makes for a nice unique backstory, however sadly it doesn’t make for a nice unique tasting bourbon. When bringing this brand back to the domestic market, Diageo is relying on the iconic I.W. Harper name instead of focusing on the bourbon in the bottle. Nothing special is currently found in the production, sourcing, and bottling of this bourbon besides Diageo marketing the Stitzel-Weller Distillery name where this bourbon was aged.","If I had tasted this blind and you told me that the bourbon I was tasting was $35, I would have assumed it was from an upstart distiller due to how young it tastes and the price. It really reminds me of bourbons aged two years or less that I’ve had from upstart distillers like 2Bar or OYO.

Knowing that it’s actually a mass scale bourbon, I’m surprised and disappointed that Diageo is trying to command the price point it’s set at. While it has a flavor profile that will easily appeal to first time bourbon drinkers, this is realistically a $20 bourbon at most. It’s not bad, but it’s nothing special. There are many other bourbons such as Four Roses Small Batch, Elijah Craig 12 Year, and Buffalo Trace at or below the $30-$35 price point that I would recommend before recommending this NAS I.W Harper.","It’s not like you’ll walk away thinking this is bad, more so...this is what is trying to pass for a $35 bourbon nowadays?!","I had high hopes for the reintroduction of this brand, however I walked away pretty let down. Another bourbon on the market without much information on where it’s produced or how old it is, selling at an inflated price. Sadly this seems to be more common nowadays. This NAS I.W. Harper tastes like any other young bourbon on the market and isn’t a standout. The market is already crowded enough with many ho-hum bourbons and we can now add one more to the list. If you’re really gunning to try this bourbon, I highly suggest you try it at a bar before buying a bottle.

After writing up my review I decided to make a Manhattan cocktail with this bourbon since it has such a simple, light flavor profile; and I’m very glad I did. The I.W. Harper made for a simple straightforward Manhattan that both bourbon drinkers and non-bourbon drinkers alike can enjoy. That being said, I wouldn’t recommend shelling out $35 just to make a simple Manhattan with this bourbon. However, if you end up with a bottle and find yourself slightly disappointed, do try using it in cocktails to help ease the pain of spending $35 on this.",Jordan,2,2,2.5,1.5,1.5,2,https://www.breakingbourbon.com/review/i-w-harper
,Michter's US*1 Bourbon,Classification: Bourbon,"Company: Chatham Imports, Inc",Distillery: Kentucky Bourbon Distillers,Released: Ongoing,Proof: 91.4,Age: NAS,Mashbill: Undisclosed,Color:  Light Amber,MSRP: $40 (2017),Official Website,Review Bottle: Batch Number 14E282,"This bourbon presents a very straightforward, light, and pleasant nose. New oak, corn, grain, and raisins were all present, but very subtle.","The palate can best be summed up as sweet with good mouthfeel. Sweet corn, honey, and vanilla are immediately noticeable when you take a sip. The palate comes off as that of a young whiskey that hasn’t spent a lot of time in the barrel.","The finish is light and lingering. Notes of oak, white pepper, honey, peaches and raisins lingered for a while in my mouth with the predominant flavor being the white pepper that brings a subtle heat and spice to the finish.","This bourbon tastes like many young bourbons I’ve had from start-up distilleries with its light nose and sweet palate profile. It reminded me of Wathen’s Single Barrel or OYO in that sense. In fact, since Michter’s does not provide an age statement and is not very straightforward about the distillery source for this bourbon, it could very well be a young product that is being bottled and sold.","Sure the bourbon tastes fine, but I can name a lot of bourbons that are just “fine” or above average for under $40. Several better values come to mind, including Eagle Rare 10 year, Four Roses Single Barrel, and Elijah Craig 12, to name just a few. A better price point for this bourbon would be $25 - that’s more of a fair value in my book for what you get for your money.",I certainly won’t be writing home to Mom about this one… skip buying a bottle and try it at a bar instead.,"While I don’t hate this bourbon, I am certainly not impressed by it either. Everything about this bourbon is just lackluster - from the start of the palate down to the price. While I’ve enjoyed other Michter’s releases such as the Michter’s Toasted Barrel Finish Bourbon, I just can’t get behind this standard offering. It would be fine for a cheap everyday house bourbon, but the problem is that it’s not priced that way. This is one of those bourbons that I’d suggest trying at your local bourbon bar vs spending the money to buy a bottle.",Jordan,2,2.5,2.5,1.5,1.5,2,https://www.breakingbourbon.com/review/michters-us-1-bourbon
,Old Bardstown Bottled in Bond Bourbon,Classification: Straight Bourbon,Company: Willett Distillery,Distillery: Willett Distillery,Released: September 2016/Ongoing,Proof: 100,Age: NAS,"Mashbill: 72% Corn, 13% Rye, 15% Malted Barley",Color: Rust,MSRP: $22 (2017),Official Website,"It’s not well documented when this brand came to be. Numerous accounts state that it was Willett’s first brand after they opened their distillery in 1935. However, this contradicts Willett’s claim that the brand got its name from a handicapped race horse in the 1950’s named “Bardstown.” During the 1970’s energy crisis, Willett Distillery stopped producing bourbon but had enough stock aging to continue releasing this brand of their own distillate until the early 1980’s. At the time, the company was rebranded as Kentucky Bourbon Distillers (KBD) and began sourcing bourbon for this brand. KBD sourced the majority of their bourbon from Heaven Hill and it is believed that is what Old Bardstown consisted of until this year.

Willett Distillery began producing their own bourbon and rye again in 2012 and started transitioning Old Bardstown sourced bourbon to their own distillate in 2016. Once available only at the distillery's gift shop, Old Bardstown BiB is now available around Kentucky and is expected to see more widespread distribution.

To be labelled BiB, the whiskey must be the product of one distillation season and one distiller at a single distillery, aged in a federally bonded warehouse under U.S. government supervision for at least four years, and it must be bottled at exactly 100 proof. Additionally, the BiB label must clearly identify the distillery where it was distilled and where it was bottled, if different.","Notes of molasses, caramel, mint, and cherry cough syrup are delivered in a straightforward way. Its youthfulness is moderately noticeable on the nose as some chemical notes pop in and out, but they aren’t detrimental to the overall package. The nose just isn’t very memorable as its positive and even its negative characteristics don’t leave a lasting impact one way or the other. It largely comes down to the lack of intensity of the scents that hold this back and keep it from reaching even middle of the road levels.","It’s surprisingly thin, both in consistency and flavor. Notes of caramel stand out over faint notes of butterscotch and oak. The palate comes across as a bit underdeveloped and fails at providing anything of lasting interest. The palate is on the right path, but it just not quite there yet.","A low yield burn on the backend that quickly dissipates. Faint notes of clove, cinnamon, and a dash of pepper do little to bring any excitement to this bourbon. It’s simply a very straightforward and average finish.","Prior releases of Old Bardstown consisted of sourced bourbon presumably from Heaven Hill. It wasn’t a terribly exciting bourbon, but it was generally consistent. Willett’s modern day reputation of being an expert sourcer wasn’t based on their Old Bardstown brand. It was due to the company’s Family Estate single barrel bourbons and ryes that have all but disappeared from shelves beyond the distillery’s gift shop. With the company back to distilling their own product after 40 years, this is the first taste most drinkers have had of Willett’s bourbon distillate.

Since the Old Bardstown brand was never known for its exceptional quality, it makes sense for the company to offload some of their new stock early as the majority of it comes of age. This might be due to financial reasons and to continue to build excitement, however there’s also the possibility certain barrels might not be showing enough promise. It’s only a theory, but it’s not uncommon for companies to unload less-than-seller stock under a lower-tier brand they own.

Much like Willett’s 2 and 3 year old rye whiskeys, their 4 year old bourbon definitely shows promise. For many that won’t be enough. With heightened expectations based on their name and history, many will go into Old Bardstown BiB expecting something amazing and the bourbon simply isn’t there yet. It’s an incredibly straightforward bourbon - almost shockingly so. This could be again why the company decided to release this bourbon under the Old Bardstown label and not under their own name. This bourbon shows how far the company still has to go before reaching the quality they became known for with their sourced bourbon releases.","Sometimes it’s hard to remember based on the fanfare and long history of the company, but Willett is a craft distillery. Anyone who has purchased a craft bourbon before never forgets the sticker shock that usually accompanies it. It’s not uncommon for craft bourbons under five years old to easily cost north of $40. Despite it being their own distillate, Willett chose to keep Old Bardstown BiB priced in the same range it was when they sourced bourbon for the brand. There are most likely many reasons they were able to do that as they aren’t exactly a new distillery, just one who is distilling bourbon again after a long hiatus.

At $22, its priced a bit on the high side compared to many budget BiB bourbons in the marketplace. Unfortunately, it doesn’t stand up flavorwise to many of these lower priced BiB bourbons, such as Old Grand-Dad, Evan Williams, and Heaven Hill. Right now Old Bardstown BiB is simply a curiosity buy. It’s priced fair for someone seeking it out for that reason and when it’s compared to other craft bourbons on the market.","Willett’s return to distilling bourbon shows promise, but little else.","There’s nothing inherently bad with this bourbon, but its lack of character has it struggling to reach even average heights. It has some youthful qualities that pull though, but unlike many young bourbons, they don’t hamper the flavor. It fact, beyond the boringness of its palate, there are signs of potential. It’s immediately noticeable how easy of a drinker it is. It’s also noteworthy of its lack of any alcohol notes despite its proof, relatively young age, and weak flavor. Not many bourbons pull this feat off especially the wealth of craft distilleries with similarly aged products on the market.

But none of this gives Old Bardstown BiB a free pass. This bottle is simply a snapshot of where Willett currently is with their new distillery and it will likely get better with future releases. For now, this is a passing curiosity of a notable Kentucky distillery transitioning back into distilling their own bourbon. It’s just unfortunate that Willett’s story is more interesting than their bourbon right now.",Eric,2,2,2.5,2,2.5,2,https://www.breakingbourbon.com/review/old-bardstown-bottled-in-bond-bourbon
,Old Fitzgerald Bottled in Bond Bourbon,Classification: Straight Bourbon,Company: Heaven Hill,Distillery: Heaven Hill,Released: Ongoing,Proof: 100,Age: NAS,"Mashbill: 75% Corn, 20% Wheat, 5% Malted Barley",Color:  Amber,MSRP: $15 (2017),Official Website,"According to Heaven Hill’s New Zealand website, John E. Fitzgerald’s original “private label” Bourbon was introduced in 1870 and soon became the exclusive Bourbon of railroad and steamship barons and was deeply integrated in the culture of the Old South. Around 1900, ""Old Fitz"" was released to the American and European public. It was one of the few whiskeys distilled using the pot still method. During Prohibition, Old Fitzgerald was distilled under government supervision for the national medicinal trade. Pappy Van Winkle soon bought the brand for $10,000 and introduced the “Whisper of Wheat” to the original recipe. Diageo eventually owned the brand and sold it to Heaven Hill in 1992, which currently produces and markets it.

This is a Bottled in Bond (BiB) bourbon. To be labelled BiB, the whiskey must be the product of one distillation season and one distiller at a single distillery, aged in a federally bonded warehouse under U.S. government supervision for at least four years, and it must be bottled at exactly 100 proof. Additionally, the BiB label must clearly identify the distillery where it was distilled and where it was bottled, if different.","An enjoyable swirl of honey, vanilla, and oak notes. Easy on the nose thanks to additional hints of candy corn and sugar cookies. Overall on the lighter side with a shallow depth of scents. Absent of any harshness.","The bourbon’s slight buttery mouthfeel acts as a enjoyable welcoming agent. It’s immediately evident that oak is the most dominant flavor. It overshadows lighter notes of vanilla and caramel that the bourbon desperately needs more of. Surprisingly, the oak doesn’t come across as overbearing despite this, just one-dimensional. This is due to the overall thinness of the bourbon and its lightweight palate. Much like the nose, there are no bad elements here, only a few OK ones.","What can best be described as a “dry heat” envelopes your mouth in the finish. The oak notes and notable burn combine to leave a rather flat and dry aftertaste. Thankfully this combination doesn’t produce a bitter aftertaste. Instead, the burn slowly mellows as it goes down. Once again the oak is the attention grabber on the finish.","At one time, having wheat as a bourbon’s secondary grain instead of rye made a whiskey unique. Old Fitzgerald was the go-to wheated bourbon for many whiskey drinkers. Maker’s Mark might have been more well-known and mainstream in the later part of the 20th Century, but it was the “Old Fitz” brand where many went for inexpensive, higher aged, higher proof wheated bourbon.

Thanks to the rise in popularity of Pappy Van Winkle there are more than a dozen wheated whiskeys in the marketplace. What was once a unique selling point for the brand, is now more common. Old Fitzgerald BiB has maintained steady availability around Kentucky over the years, but has disappeared from many other parts of the country. Some believe its phasing out is the result of the Heaven Hill rebranding it as “Larceny” as they share the same mashbill. With Larceny arguably a better product and readily available in most parts of the country, there's little need in seeking out Old Fitzgerald anymore.","Coming in at half the cost of many comparable wheated bourbons, Old Fitzgerald’s bargain price does a lot to make up for its shortcomings. This is another budget BiB bourbon on the market that is made for a everyday drinking. It’s inexpensive and easy to drink. It shares many common traits with other sub-$20 whiskeys; it’s thin, lacks flavor depth, is heavily oaked, yet still very drinkable.

Comparing it to Larceny and Maker’s Mark, Old Fitzgerald is notably hotter and its palate a bit more meager. The brands do share many similarities, most damningly their lack of depth, but Larceny and Maker’s Mark’s fuller tasting and rounder palates are ultimately more enjoyable. Old Fitzgerald is priced exactly what it should be. Any more would be asking too much.","A one-dimensional palate makes this forgettable, but its limited availability is the real reason you’ll give this a look.","There isn’t a lot to love with Old Fitzgerald BiB. It’s very drinkable and some might enjoy its mild burn, but its lack of depth extinguishes any excitement I might have had for it. On a tight budget it marginally gets a pass, but I’d readily suggest Heaven Hill BiB or Evan Williams BiB over it. Larceny, for a few bucks more and a higher average age (6 to 12 years according to Heaven Hill’s press release), is a more than adequate substitution for this. If you come across Old Fitzgerald BiB purchase it with tempered expectations. Due to its limited availability, it’s nothing more than a passing curiosity at this point.",Eric,2.5,2,2,2,2.5,2,https://www.breakingbourbon.com/review/old-fitzgerald-bottled-in-bond-bourbon
,Parker’s Heritage Collection: Heavy Char Barrels Straight Rye,Classification: Straight Rye,Company: Heaven Hill,Distillery: Heaven Hill,Release Date: September 2019,Proof: 105,Age: 8 Years,"Mashbill: 51% Rye, 35% Corn, 14% Malted Barley",Color: Burnt Copper,Price: $150 (2019),Official Website,"This release represents the 13th edition of the Parker’s Heritage Collection, which is released annually in September each year. This is the first rye to be released in the series, and utilizes Heaven Hill’s standard rye whiskey mashbill.

However, unlike the customary Level 3 charred barrels used for aging Heaven Hill ryes, this whiskey was aged in Level 5 char barrels for 8 years and 9 months on the 7th floor of Rickhouse Y. Level 5 charred barrels are charred for a total of 90 seconds, which is 50 seconds longer than the Level 3 charred barrels. Distillers char barrels from Level 1 to Level 7, and typically uses Level 3 (you can learn more about the process here). The additional char is said to allow the whiskey to extract deeper notes of spice and wood in the resulting flavor. The end result is a 75 barrel release that is bottled without chill filtration at 105 proof. While the actual total bottle yield is unknown, making some assumptions about evaporation loss and proof out of the barrels suggests a total yield of around 15,000 - 20,000 bottles.

The series is named after the late Heaven Hill Master Distiller Parker Beam who passed away as a result of ALS (otherwise known as Lou Gehrig’s disease). Like each Parker’s Heritage Collection release since 2013’s “Promise of Hope,” a portion of the proceeds for each bottle sold will be donated to the ALS Association in his honor. To learn more about the background of this year’s edition, be sure to check out the company Press Release.","Rye spice and barrel char best characterize the nose, however they have to fight through a wall of ethanol heat to make their presence known. A trace amount of caramel peeks through as well, adding a sweet element to the mix. The heat overshadows the other scents making for a meek showing and overall aroma that's subpar and uninviting.","Heat up front gives way to dark fruits and leather followed by a crescendo of spice. It’s nearly one dimensional, with heat and spice taking the forefront against the other flavors present. Because of this, it tastes hotter than its 105 proof and not in an enjoyable way. While it isn’t downright bad, the impression I’m left with is a slightly negative one.","Flavors open up in the finish, with caramel, baking spices, seasoned oak, and clove coming forward with ferocity. Rye spice slowly comes back into play without the accompanying heat present before, making for a nicely balanced sweet-spice combination that lingers for some time. It’s the most complex part of the sip, and while it doesn’t necessarily provide enough oomph to make up for the other shortcomings, it does end the sip on a positive note.","Heaven Hill produces what would appear to be a very similar whiskey, Pikesville Rye. It shares the same mashbill and is only 5 proof points higher at 110, however it’s a little younger at 6 years old and is aged in Heaven Hill’s more standard Level 3 charred barrels. It retails for around $55 and is considered a premium quality rye at its price point.

Exploring other distilleries reveals the typical char level used is between char levels 3 and 4. While the exact burn time might vary a bit by distillery or barrel cooper, the range is relatively small and could rightly be described as the “sweet spot.” Higher char levels have certainly been used in experimentation, and likely are being used on a smaller scale on a more regular basis. One example that comes to mind is a Buffalo Trace Experimental Collection, “#7 Heavy Char Barrel,” in which 7 barrels were charred for 3.5 minutes and then bourbon Mash #2 was aged in the barrels for over 15 years. Notably, Buffalo Trace has not switched to #7 charred barrels as a result of that experiment.

The resulting flavor profile of the Parker’s Heavy Char Barrels Rye is unremarkable. It drinks hotter than 105 proof, and taking Parker’s Rye 5 proof points down from Pikesville Rye suggests it was too hot at a higher proof. I assume Heaven Hill would have known many would compare it side by side with Pikesville Rye looking for notable attributes that would suggest a higher value, such as a higher proof point, decreasing the proof as a necessity to keep the heat in check.","As noted, this release shares a number of similarities with Heaven Hill’s Pikesville Rye, a regularly available premium whiskey offered at $55. Parker’s contrasts Pikeville by adding two years and Level 5 charred barrels, however that difference from a value perspective is nominal. For nearly triple the cost, I would expect the flavor profile to carry the majority of the weight from a value perspective.

I approached this open-minded believing it was possible. Eight years old for a rye can be a sweet spot, as can around 100 proof. I thought of the 2013 release as a comparison: Parker’s Heritage Promise of Hope, which was essentially Henry McKenna offered at 4 proof points lower and for nearly triple the price at the time. It too seemed a bit over-the-top at first...until I tried it. Immediately I knew it was something special despite its relatively unimpressive stats.

Comparing further, it’s worth noting 2018 Parker’s Heritage Collection - Bourbon Finished in Orange Curacao Barrels, was offered at a $90 MSRP. 2011 Parker’s Heritage - 11 Year Single Barrel (122 proof), was offered at $130 MSRP. This pricing would suggest something close to $90-$100 for 2019’s release might be appropriate and on par with Heaven Hill’s historical pricing structure for this series. Given the change in the market and corresponding $150 MSRP, I assumed this year’s release might have the same magic as Promise of Hope, and tripling the price of its closest counterpart (Pikesville Rye) was certainly pushing it, but not necessarily unreasonable.

Unfortunately the taste isn’t anywhere near what I would expect for a special limited release whiskey with a $150 MSRP, a massive let-down given my expectations. Taking this into account, my opinion on value is much more clear. $150 is overpriced by a long-shot. I can’t fault Heaven Hill for wanting to elevate their brand portfolio into more premium pricing territory as we are starting to see. But just because you can, doesn’t mean you should. The logic that can be applied to one bottle in a portfolio cannot necessarily be applied to another.

I do appreciate the fact that some of the proceeds are being donated to the ALS Association. In the past this has ranged from $10-$20 per bottle depending on the edition starting with 2013’s Promise of Hope release. However the amount per bottle donated with this edition is unknown, and likely not enough to warrant such an increase in price over expectation given what’s inside the bottle.","While it’s satisfying to finally experience a rye released as part of the Parker’s Heritage Collection, this year’s edition is not the rye we’ve been waiting for, falling short of expectations in nearly every aspect.","The Parker’s Heritage Collection explores unique areas of American Whiskey with remarkable success, and as a result is one of the limited releases I look forward to most each year. While offering such variety is a notable attribute of the series, it also presents a large risk as consumers are not always appreciative of the experimental nature of such variety contained within an ongoing limited series. While some may not be for everyone, I would argue they have generally been exemplary results of their stated attributes. Moreover, Heaven Hill has varied the pricing each year generally aligning it fairly with what was inside the bottle.

2019’s edition is not an exemplary release and unlike some of the more polarizing previous releases I feel few will find something to like with it. I had hoped that while the age was not impressive, the Level 5 char and ultimately the barrels selected for the batch could be something great - much like 2013’s Promise of Hope release which was also very unimpressive on paper, but goes down as one of my favorite bourbons of all time. Unfortunately, 2019’s edition is seriously disappointing when taking everything into account. While the best course of action would have been to release this under something other than the Parker’s Heritage Collection, some saving grace could have been had by keeping the price somewhere under $100. Instead, an inflated $150 price tag and subpar sip masked with heat makes this a limited release to pass on. Heaven Hill has made their name producing many fantastic products for a fair price, releasing some of their absolute best within the Parker’s Heritage Collection. I hold out hope that this is simply an anomaly for a brand, and not the beginning of a trend for future editions.

,Pinhook Bohemian Bourbon High Proof,Classification: Straight Bourbon,Company: CJS Beverage Corp.,Distillery: Castle & Key,Release Date: April 2020,Proof: 114.5,Age: 34 months,"Mashbill: 75% Corn, 15% Rye, 10% Malted Barley",Color: Golden Hay,MSRP: $50,Official Website,"To date, Pinhook has sourced their bourbon from MGP, but Bohemian Bourbon High Proof marks a drastic change for the company. For the last few years they have been contract distilling a proprietary mashbill with Castle & Key Distillery. Bohemian Bourbon High Proof was distilled and aged at Castle & Key. A total of 100 barrels were blended and proofed by Sean Josephs, Pinhook’s co-founder and master taster to create this bourbon. Bohemian is the first bourbon to come out of the resurrected Old Taylor Distillery since it was abandoned in 1972.","Lively and bright, the nose opens with light ripe pears, a bouquet of floral scents, and a hint of caramel which does a good job of masking its higher proof. Inhaling deeper brings out corn and new oak, which remind you of the youth of the bourbon, but also mingle nicely with the other scents. While it’s not an overly complex nose, it’s enjoyable and one that seems suited for the late spring season in which it was released.","The youth of the bourbon radiates in the palate as bitter wet oak and corn take center stage. These are joined with rye spice and green peppercorns. The palate has an oily mouthfeel and is not shy in displaying its high proof title. Fighting to get out from behind the heat are sweeter notes of vanilla and caramel which try to balance out the more bitter notes. However, the heat makes that hard to do, leading to an unbalanced overall palate.","The high proof of the bourbon combines with a burst of spice to start off a fiery finish. Once these dominant flavors die down, they’re followed by a drier flavor of leather along with a very light note of dried peach. Unfortunately, that wet oak flavor carries over to the finish and casts its shadow during a long slow burn down.","For the years leading up to this release, Pinhook has exclusively used bourbon sourced from MGP for their brand. This is a common tactic used by many new brands while they distill or contract distill their own spirits and wait patiently for them to come of age. In Pinhook's case, they went with contract distilling from Castle & Key and are the first brand to have a bourbon distilled and released from the historic Taylor Distillery site. While this was always Pinhook’s plan , it also involves a calculated risk. For the past number of years Pinhook has accustomed their fanbase to one flavor profile, mainly younger MGP, while it now tries to transition everyone to an entirely new profile. In this case, Pinhook definitely is on the road to a distinctly unique product.

Unfortunately in the case of Bohemian Bourbon High Proof, the flavor profile leaves you with the feeling that it still has room to develop with more time in the barrel. Credit needs to be given to Pinhook for making the switch and for working with new distillery. While Pinhooks Rye’d On showcased their new distillate from Castle & Key well, it’s also sometimes easier for younger rye to shine compared to younger bourbon. It will be interesting to see how it continues to develop, especially as more age is added to the barrels.""","Bohemian Bourbon High Proof's price tag of $50 is in line with other newer Kentucky distilled brands such as Wilderness Trail. It’s a price point that at face value seems fair for a small batch high proof bourbon, until you start comparing its flavor profile to those around it. Compared to New Riff’s higher proof offerings, Bohemian Bourbon High Proof seems to be lacking a certain well-balanced flavor profile. While Wilderness Trail and New Riff offer slightly more age with their products, their price price point feels more in line with the value the overall sip delivers. There’s no doubt that $50 will eventually be the right price for Pinhook’s Castle & Key distilled Bourbon High Proof product, however that time isn't right now.","Pinhook Bohemian Bourbon will gather a lot of attention because it’s the first modern bourbon release distilled at Castle & Key, unfortunately it's a little rough around the edges and still has some growing up to do.","Pinhook Bohemian Bourbon High Proof has some redeeming qualities to it such as its balanced nose and the uniqueness it brings, however its off-balanced palate and finish along with its high price tag are enough to make one ponder before buying a bottle. Ultimately, what Bohemian Bourbon does succeed in is showing the potential that the brand has in store for the future. While its young age may not allow it to reveal its full potential, it does show enough promise to assume that with more time in the barrel, Pinhook's offering distilled at Castle & Key will be something to look forward to.

,Smooth Ambler Contradiction,Classification: A Blend of Straight Bourbon,Company: Smooth Ambler,Distillery: Smooth Ambler & Sourced,Released: Ongoing,Proof: 100,Age: NAS (Blend of 2 year & 9 year bourbons),"Mashbill: Blend of 60% Corn, 20% Wheat, 20% Malted Barley and 75% Corn, 21% Rye, 4% Malted Barley",Color:  Deep Copper,MSRP: $55 (2016),Official Website,"This batch of Contradiction is a blend of straight bourbons containing 27% of a 2 year old wheated bourbon made in-house at the Smooth Ambler distillery, along with 73% of a 9 year old rye based bourbon sourced from MGP in Indiana. For Contradiction, the bourbons are blended and then re-casked in their original barrels for an additional three months.

The 2 year bourbon consists of a mashbill of 60% corn, 20% wheat, and 20% malted barley. The 9 year bourbon contains a mashbill of 75% corn, 21% rye, and 4% malted barley, and is normally bottled and sold as Smooth Ambler Old Scout. The end result is a blended bourbon that contains a four grain blend, consisting of corn, rye, wheat, and malted barley.

The bottle reviewed came from Batch 6 and was bottled by Sean.","The older rye based bourbon does a nice job of covering up the contents of the younger wheated bourbon as the nose offers little hint that young distillate is present. Instead, hints of sweet wheat, rye spice, baking spices, green apples, dried fruit, and young wood are present. Additionally, very little alcohol is present. The nose is pleasant, yet I was hoping to experience something a little more complex considering this is a four grain bourbon.","The youthful wheat component of the bourbon pops out on first sip. New oak, corn, bubble gum, hints of dark chocolate, and slight amounts of vanilla and honey are present along with a healthy dose of rye spice. Less sweet than the nose and much spicier, the flavor combination seems like it would work great, but in reality the palate comes across as nothing more than ho-hum. I was really hoping there would be more interplay between the older rye and the more youthful wheat seeing as they were left to meld for an additional three months in the barrels. Even though the young wheated component makes up just 27% of the overall blend, this component makes a more pronounced impact, while the rye just seems to bring an enhanced spice level.","Spicy upfront and dry in the back, the finish tastes like twist on a version of your typical MGP rye based bourbon. Heavy rye spice, charred oak, and light vanilla all make an immediate appearance. This is followed by leather and a lot of aged oak to cap it off. The finish lingers for too long and overstays it’s welcome, as it feels like I am chewing on a toothpick after a while. If you like really woody, dry finishes then this is for you. The finish is the opposite of the palate in the sense that the younger wheated bourbon seemingly has no impact here.","A blended bourbon containing a total of four grains spread out between a young wheated bourbon and a mature rye bourbon is definitely not something that comes along every day. Kudos to Smooth Ambler for giving this a go and bringing something unique to the market. I wish more distilleries and non distiller producers would take chances with four grain blends like this one.

The interesting part of this bourbon is that even though the blend had time to meld together over the three months it spent in the barrels, I really don’t feel the end result pushes the envelope. Instead of a harmony of flavors, this still tastes like two distinct separate bourbons at different times. It’s really not bad, however that being said, the flavor profile itself isn’t all that memorable either.","At $55 this is a high cost to pay for the final product. While I didn’t walk away disappointed, I keep coming back to the fact that for the same price, I have tasted far better blends. In fact, both Highwest Double Ryewhich consists of a young whiskey blended with an old whiskey and Son of Bourye which consists of younger blended bourbon and rye are superior products for a reasonable price. I also find it ironic that you can pick up a bottle of Smooth Ambler’s Old Scout 7 year for less and experience a more refined tasting experience.",An interesting experiment that is priced too high for the experience it delivers.,"Smooth Ambler Contradiction is an interesting product and a great way for Smooth Ambler to introduce some of their younger distillate to the market. Sure the in-house bourbon used is aged for less time than what their own distilled bourbon will be aged and bottled at, it’s nice to get a preview of it nonetheless. Additionally, I would like to see more experimentation with four grain blends like this one, and credit needs to be given to Smooth Ambler for experimenting with such a unique blend.

While an interesting concept in theory, I’m left wondering why I’d opt to purchase a bottle of this again. Especially considering the fact that you can pick up any of the great Smooth Ambler bourbon lines for less or the same, or even hunt down a private selection for a few more bucks. I wouldn’t necessarily say that this should cause concern for the future of in-house distilling at Smooth Ambler, however I would say they have a ways to go before they master the art of blending to the degree High West has.",Jordan,2.5,2,2,3,2,2,https://www.breakingbourbon.com/review/smooth-ambler-contradiction
,Stagg Jr. Bourbon - Batch 1,Classification: Straight Bourbon,Company: Sazerac Company Inc.,Distillery: Buffalo Trace,Released: Fall 2013 / Ongoing,Proof: 134.4 (Batch 1),Age: NAS (BT has stated 7 years),Mashbill: Undisclosed,Color:  Deep Amber,MSRP: $55 (2017),Official Website,"The notes on the bottle indicate the bourbon ages for “nearly a decade,” and is thought to be 8-9 years. Buffalo Trace in 2017 confirmed it to be 7 years. This is the essentially a younger version of the widely acclaimed George T. Stagg with a different flavor profile due to the fact that it shares the same mash bill but Trace is not as particular with barrel locations as they are with the original and, to state the obvious, it's not aged as long either. George T. Stagg is a bourbon on many enthusiasts’ top 5 list and part of the annual Buffalo Trace Antique Collection (BTAC) release. Stagg Jr was first released in 2013 and will be continue to be released in small batches at varying proofs unless Buffalo Trace decides to do otherwise.","I let this sit in the glass for about 10 minutes before nosing it. Even then my nostrils fill with alcohol. Raisins, citrus, chocolate, and caramel also manage to pull through. This is expected for the proof but it’s not a warming burn like Knob Creek Single Barrel. It’s more of a deterrent for me.","Very hot. Traces of raisins and citrus mingle throughout, but are muted by the sharpness of the heat. If you read my review on High West Double Rye, I talk about spice without heat. This is the exact opposite, it’s heat without spice. I don’t care for it to this extreme and it makes for a fairly unpleasant and unbalanced sip.","A sharp dose of pepper dominates the initial burn, almost like biting into a peppercorn accidentally. After this spike the heat lingers for a bit. Ironically, the burn is kind of nice once you get past the initial sting, making for a long lasting sweet finish rounded out with elements of burnt brown sugar, caramel, and dark chocolate.","Although the barrel proof options are growing, there are still a limited number of options out there. Consumers are demanding higher proof offerings and we’re seeing those move fairly quickly off the shelves. This is a limited batch release, meaning that Buffalo Trace has been releasing this in fairly small batches 3-4 times annually at varying proofs as enough bourbon meets the desired flavor profile. It’s deliberately inferior to George T. Stagg, as this is necessary to maintain the status of that annually released product as a top notch and sought after bourbon, with Stagg Jr being a prelude to what is to come only once a year. Elijah Craig is also doing this with their barrel proofoffering, and we have seen that move very quickly from the liquor store shelves as well. The flavor profile of Stagg Jr may not be to my liking, but it is unique none-the-less. From other opinions I’ve read that the releases vary in quality and they seem to be getting better as time progresses. Bourbon enthusiasts will need to try this themselves in order to make their own determination. For me, it’s uniqueness of flavor is the best thing Stagg Jr has going for it.","Despite the fact that I find this overly hot, not everyone shares this opinion. I’ve even heard people say they like it better than the original George T. Stagg. Based on this and the fact that it’s around 8-9 years old (or 7 years based on recent BT comments) and released at barrel proof, an MSRP of $50 is really a fair deal. If this were more balanced I would rate it higher, but the fact remains that Buffalo Trace still has some work to do in choosing the barrels to batch together for this younger release in order to gain mass appeal and uphold an ongoing market. Now that the newness has worn off, we’ll see if enough people like this to continue sales at the same rate they’ve been so far.","For me, this is a hot mess. However, due to its unique flavor profile not everyone will feel that way so this is really one you will need to sample for yourself.","This is one I wanted to love. In fact, at my first opportunity I bought 2 bottles before ever trying it just to be sure I’d have enough. Unfortunately, I just can’t seem to find enjoyment with this bourbon. Although it maintains a unique flavor profile the excessive heat drowns out the finer attributes this bourbon strives for. Where George T. Stagg is a robust and truly remarkable bourbon, Stagg Jr feels more like an unfinished product that still needs some time in the barrel to round things out.

I tried to revive this by adding water, mixing with other bourbons, and even mixing in drinks. No matter what I did, it seemed to bring a hot strange flavor wherever it went. With some water, it does mute the heat but mutes the flavors right along with it. The warming burn in the finish which was my favorite part of the sip without water also disappears. Unfortunately, I think the only solutions are better barrel selection or just simply being someone with a taste preference for what’s in this bottle.",Nick,2,1,3,4,3.5,2,https://www.breakingbourbon.com/review/stagg-jr-bourbon
,Wathen's Single Barrel Bourbon,Classification: Straight Bourbon,Company: Medley Family,Distillery: Sourced,"Released: February 14, 2013",Proof: 94,Age: NAS,"Mashbill: 77% Corn, 10% Rye, and 13% Malted Barely",Color:  Rose Gold,MSRP: $35 (2014),Official Website,"The Medley family has a long storied history when it comes to bourbon distillation.  They’ve been a family of master distillers going back 8 generations. In fact, they play up that fact front and center on the label of this bourbon with a big number 8, which at first glance can almost be mistaken for an age statement. However don’t let that 8 on the bottle fool you into thinking it’s an age statement, this is most certainly a NAS Bourbon.

This bottle of Wathen’s Single Barrel (Barrel number 5833) uses the standard mashbill that all of the Medley bourbons use: 77% corn, 10% rye, and 13% malt. While Charles Medley distilled bourbon up until the late 1900’s, the Medley family now sources all their Bourbon. This Wathen’s Single Barrel is a NDP bourbon with research pointing to the fact that the Medley family contracts out their specific mashbill to be distilled. While no distillery is confirmed, most people assume that Heaven Hill is the one filling the contract. That being said, any distillery could theoretically produce this bourbon to the specifications of the Medley Family.","The nose on Wathen’s is one of the lightest I’ve experienced. The slightest traces of alcohol are mixed with very light traces of new wood, straw and vanilla. Interestingly I picked up a stronger sense of fresh peeled bananas on top of everything.","The palate doesn’t blow you away on this single barrel. Initially, you’re presented with a strong taste of clove and walnuts. Lingering behind that is a light sweet orange citrus taste.","The finish on this bottle of Wathen’s was shorter than what I'd prefer for a single barrel. The finish starts off with a mixture of charred wood and lightly spiced pepper and ends on tones of sugary raisins. While not bad by any means, it also didn’t wow me.","This single barrel Wathen’s is interesting. The only sure thing you can count on is that this bourbon has a consistent mashbill (77% corn, 10% rye, and 13% malt).Other than that, little else is known about this bourbon. With no age statement, rumors online suggest the age could be anywhere from 4 to 8 or 9 years. While this allows the Medley family to choose from various barrel samples and bottle the bourbon when they feel it’s ready, it also means that you truly have no idea what you’re drinking. If I had to take a guess based on the color and flavors present, I’d say this is a 4-6 year old bourbon.","At $35 for this single barrel, it's priced higher than it should be. You’re not sure how old the bourbon is or where it’s really produced. On top of that, if you really want to drink a single barrel bourbon, you can find a great one for much less or a little more (i.e. Evan Williams Single Barrel for less or Four Roses single barrel for just a few dollars more).",If only the bourbon was as complex as the story around its source.,"I walked away from this bourbon pretty disappointed. The nose and palate are both bland and leave a lot to be desired. The mashbill would suggest that this should be a sweeter bourbon based on the high amount of corn used. However, I only really started tasting the sweetness when it came to the finish, and even then it was brief. This combined with the higher price point doesn’t help its cause either and really leads to an overall sub-par bourbon.",Jordan,2,1.5,2.5,2,1.5,2,https://www.breakingbourbon.com/review/wathens-single-barrel-bourbon
,Woodford Reserve Distiller's Select Rye,Classification: Straight Rye,Company: Brown-Forman,Distillery: Woodford Reserve Disrtillery / Brown-Forman,Released: Ongoing,Proof: 90.4,Age: NAS (Said to be 6-7 years old),"Mashbill: 53% Rye, 33% Corn, 14% Malted Barley",Color:  Light Gold,MSRP: $38,Official Website,"Woodford Reserve Distiller's Select Rye is the third brand in the Woodford portfolio, which also includes the original Woodford Reserve Distiller's Select Bourbon and Woodford Reserve Double Oaked. In 2011, Woodford produced both an aged cask rye and a new cask rye as part of their Master’s Collection, however those were one time releases vs. this new release, which will be ongoing. The bottle we reviewed is number is 004 from batch number 05605.

It should be noted that this isn’t Brown-Forman’s first time producing a rye. After the Heaven Hill's Bardstown Distillery was destroyed by a fire in November 1996,  Heaven Hill's rye whiskey  Rittenhouse was made at Brown-Forman. This continued through 2008 when production was fully moved to their Bernheim Distillery. It’s smart that Brown-Forman continued to use this rye knowledge to move into their own brand after the production of Rittenhouse moved back to Heaven Hill.","I’ve always found the regular Woodford bourbon to have a low-key nose, and their new rye is no different. The nose is incredibly light, and I really have to inhale deeply to pull out anything substantial from it. Ever so subtle hints of rye, new wood, and strange as it may be, light rubber are present upfront. While lingering longer  on the nose produce hints of sweet pears and honey crisp apples. It’s a shame how incredibly light this nose actually is seeing as the flavors work well together when you're able to actually pick them up. Additionally, slight traces of alcohol are present which is surprising since it’s only 90 proof.","While it’s definitely a rye, it’s a very subtle one at that. A peppery rye spice is present the moment you take a sip from the glass. Honey, fresh apples, and vanilla are also present. Seeing as Woodford chose to only use 53% rye in this bottle (legal definition of a rye is 51%), it doesn’t surprise me that this flavor profile leans more towards a bourbon than the typical spiciness I associate with a more traditional rye. That being said, while the taste is very pleasing, when I go to pour a rye, I actually want to be able to distinguish it as a rye and not think how close the flavor profile is to a traditional bourbon.","The finish thankfully makes up for the lack of a nose and palate. It starts off as an upfront spicy mix of light pepper and leather with a dash of heat, which slowly morphs into a nice combination of pears lightly dipped in honey and vanilla. The finish is definitely the highlight. It lasts longer than I was expecting, and the delicious combination of flavors lingers and slowly fades away over a few minutes.","In a world full of ryes, Woodford’s new entry into the market certainly isn’t anything groundbreaking. What was surprising though, was how sweet the flavor profile is that Brown-Forman chose for this offering. Sure you find just a hint of a distinctive spice of a rye, however you’re greeted predominantly with sweet flavors that stand out above any traditional rye traits. Much like their bourbon, I felt they picked a middle of the road route trying to please more of the occasional rye drinker vs. someone looking for a rye with a lot of flavor. If you’re looking for a unique rye, you’ll have to look elsewhere.","Taking into account that Brown-Forman markets Woodford as a premium brand, it’s no surprise that they gave the new Woodford Rye a premium price. At $38 a bottle, it’s not the most expensive rye on the market by any means, however when you take into account the whiskey in the bottle, it’s also not the best value. Personally, I would prefer to see this sold for $25-$30, as I feel that would be a fair asking price for what you’re getting.",A rye with big potential that falls short due to a flavor profile that can’t back it up.,"Like most releases by Woodford, I’m sure this will be a polarizing product. People tend to either love or hate the brand, which is a shame since, despite the losers (for example 2014 Sonoma-Cutrer Finish Masters Collection), they’ve actually produced a good mix of winners in the past. That being said, I feel the new Woodford Rye isn’t a bad offering, however it’s also not one to write home about either. My biggest complaint is that I wish they had raised the proof about 8-10 points higher to bring out more of the flavors along with raising the actual percentage of rye used in the mashbill. It has potential to be really good, but not in its current form. I could see recommending this if you’re a big fan of the regular Woodford Reserve Bourbon or looking for a one-size-fits-all rye to keep as the one bottle of rye in your bar to please guests. That being said, it’s overpriced for a straight-at-home-pourer, and underproofed to use as a good cocktail rye.",Jordan,2,2,3,1.5,2,2,https://www.breakingbourbon.com/review/woodford-reserve-distillers-select-rye
,Woodford Reserve Double Double Oaked,Classification: Straight Bourbon,Company: Brown-Forman,Distillery: Woodford Reserve Distillery / Brown-Forman Distillery,Released: Ongoing,Proof: 90.4,Age: NAS,"Mashbill: 72% Corn, 18% Rye, 10% Malted Barley",Color: Dark Burnt Amber,MSRP: $50 (375ml) (2017),Official Website,"Woodford Reserve Double Double Oaked is a limited edition release by Brown-Forman. Falling under the company’s Distillery Series, this bourbon is released in limited batches. The Woodford Distillery Series is released s in 375ml bottles, and can only be bought at the distillery’s gift shop. Woodford Double Oaked is produced by re-barreling Woodford Reserve Distiller’s Select in a second virgin charred oak barrel for a little under a year. The second barrel used is deeply toasted before being lightly charred. Double Double Oaked is produced by finishing Woodford Reserve Double Oaked for an additional year.

The bottle being reviewed is from the Fall 2016 release, which at the time of this review is still being sold in the gift shop. Photos are taken from a prior release.","The additional time in a second barrel is quite noticeable. The heavy oak notes makes the nose comes across slightly stronger than its 90.4 proof. Hiding behind the oak are wafts of sweeter caramel, brown sugar, rye spice, and a dollop of syrup. The scents mingle nicely together and provide an enjoyable aroma.","Upon taking a sip, my mouth is coated as if I just took a shot of some sort of cooking oil. Its mouthfeel is viscous but oddly in a weird one-dimensional way. The dominant flavor is rich charred oak with the ever so slightest dab of vanilla, and without much support besides these two flavors. In fact I’d be exaggerating if I said I was able to pull out any other noticeable flavors besides the oak. While it’s thankfully a nicely balanced oak flavor, the one-dimensionality of this palate is really a shame. The extra year in the wood seems to have muted all the best parts of the standard Double Oaked leaving only the oak behind.","The oak carries through to the finish and is joined with leather, caramel, brown sugar, and dried raisins up front. Eventually all the flavors drop off except for heavy dry charred oak and light brown sugar which lingers for a surprisingly long time. In the end the dry oaky taste overstays it’s welcome and reinforces the fact that this has spent a longer time in the barrel than need be.","Woodford Double Double Oaked is certainly unique, but not in a non-typical way. It’s oaky flavor profile, while not defying any new boundaries, helps show the limitations of barrel finishing in a second new charred oak barrel. Where Double Oaked seems to be aged just the right amount of time, Double Double Oaked comes across as taking it too far. Its narrow flavor profile is a clear result of spending too much time in the second barrel. However without this extra year of aging, we wouldn’t have had the chance to know what the limitations actually are of double oaked bourbons.","Priced at $5 more than Double Oaked, this would seem like a fair value. That is until you realize you’re getting half the product compared to Double Oaked, due to the fact that Double Double Oaked is only sold in 375ml bottles. This puts its 750ml equivalent pricing in line with Woodford’s Master’s Collection and over twice the cost of a standard bottle of Double Oaked. It certainly presents a unique experience, but the flavor profile does not elevate this bourbon anywhere near its asking price.",Double Double Oaked shows that doubling the time and doubling the oak is one equation that doesn’t add up.,"Double Double Oaked seemed like it should be the next natural progression in the Woodford family lineup. Where Distiller’s Select lays an average base, and Double Oaked morphs it into a lovely above average bourbon, Double Double Oaked seems like it should have lifted the whole family up to the next level. Sadly, this isn’t the case at all. The extra time in the barrel leaves the bourbon over-oaked and one-dimensional. Add in the fact that it’s priced slightly higher than Double Oaked but in half-sized bottles, and this is one tough sell.

,Woodford Reserve Wheat Whiskey,Classification: Wheat Whiskey,Company: Brown-Forman,Distillery: Woodford Reserve Distillery / Brown-Forman Distillery,Release Date: July 2019/Ongoing,Proof: 90.4,Age: NAS,"Mashbill: 52% Wheat, 20% Malted Barley, 20% Corn, 8% Rye",Color: Golden Bronze,MSRP: $35,Website,"Woodford Reserve Wheat Whiskey is the latest addition to the Woodford Reserve family. This four grain whiskey is considered a wheat whiskey because its mashbill contains just over 50% wheat. According to Woodford Master Distiller Chris Morris, “After Prohibition, the federal government permitted four styles of American straight whiskey, each with a different majority grain – bourbon, rye, wheat and malt. Woodford Reserve now has all four whiskeys as part of its permanent family of brands – Woodford Bourbon, Woodford Rye, Woodford Malt and now Woodford Wheat.” The whiskey being reviewed is from Label Batch 0038, Bottle #0572.","The nose is soft and fruity. Baked peach pie, cinnamon, hay, and light oak all mingle together. Digging deeper produces hints of vanilla along with apple juice and canned pears. Its lightness is evidence of its proof, however that doesn’t necessarily mean bad in this case. The scents are light yet still provide a nice introduction to this whiskey.","Flavors of oak, wheat grain, and a hint of vanilla are immediate and dominate. This whiskey has a really dry mouthfeel that is best described as the complete opposite of viscous. Rolling this whiskey around brings about a more prominent note of wet oak. Compared to the good start the nose presents, the palate is weak and doesn’t deliver like you’d hope it would.","Much like the rest of the sip, the finish is on the lighter side. White pepper, oak, and hints of dried apple and peaches lead the charge. While light, the finish is also lingering with notes of dried peaches intermingled with vanilla. It’s not an awful way to end the sip, but far from anything to write home about either.","Woodford Reserve Wheat Whiskey enters a category that isn’t very crowded by American whiskey producers, and one that usually doesn’t attract a lot of new arrivals either. American wheat whiskeys aren’t too common, even at the craft distillery level. When focusing on the large Kentucky distillery level, only Heaven Hill produces a wheat whiskey, Bernheim Original Kentucky Straight Wheat Whiskey.

Woodford Reserve Wheat and Bernheim Original are actually very similar. Both come in the 90 proof range, and both are barely legal wheat whiskeys. At 52% and 51% wheat respectively, Bernheim only has a three grain mashbill while Woodford one-ups it with a four grain mashbill. However Bernheim carries a seven year age statement while Woodford does not have an age statement, so it could be as young as four years old.

If you normally like wheated bourbons, Woodford Reserve Wheat delivers a profile that is clearly different from a standard bourbon wheated mashbill. That said, different doesn’t equate to better in this case. It’s not the most standout wheat whiskey on the market, and is more akin to Woodford Rye in the sense of it not succeeding at showcasing the unique attributes of the primary grain. Much like that release, I wish they would either increase the proof or the amount of the primary grain to really make more of a noticeable impact. That said you have to give Woodford credit for trying to tackle this niche category of whiskey.","Coming in at only $35, Woodford Reserve Wheat is priced at only a few dollars more than Bernheim, yet still close enough that it’s in direct competition. It may not deliver a standout flavor profile, however it’s not trying to gouge consumers either. It’s hard to ignore that unless you're a diehard Woodford supporter, otherwise I think more people will be likely to go for an age stated whiskey for a few dollars less. Ideally I would prefer to see this for about $5 less, but in today’s whiskey environment it provides the opportunity to try a name brand wheat whiskey, which many will not have had exposure to before.",Woodford Reserve Wheat Whiskey is a play-it-safe wheat whiskey that delivers a lackluster and unsatisfying sip.,"Woodford Reserve Wheat Whiskey feels like it has potential to be so much more than what it delivers. The nose, while light, starts off nicely and is full of scents that you hope will be present in the rest of the sip. Unfortunately, the palate and the finish drop the ball. The flavors come across as more muted and uninteresting, and really leave you longing for more. Would this have been better with a higher percentage of wheat in the mashbill? I don’t know, but I’d love to find out.

That’s mainly the issue I have with Woodford’s non-bourbon standard releases. While a barely legal malt percentage worked well for Woodford Reserve Malt, that same barely legal strategy doesn’t pay off for Woodford Reserve Rye or Woodford Reserve Wheat. For those who are interested in trying a wheat whiskey, don't expect a whiskey that tastes as unique as you might like it to be.",Jordan,2.5,2,2,3,2.5,2,https://www.breakingbourbon.com/review/woodford-reserve-wheat-whiskey
,FEW Bourbon Whiskey,Classification: Bourbon,Company: FEW Spirits LLC,Distillery: FEW Spirits,Released: Ongoing,Proof: 93,Age: Less than 4 Years,"Mashbill: 70% Corn, 20% Northern Rye, 10% 2-Row Malt",Color:  Deep Reddish Copper,MSRP: $50 (2017),Official Website,"FEW Spirits was founded in 2011 by Paul Hletko. The distillery is located outside of Chicago in Evanston, Illinois. The name is taken from Frances Elizabeth Willard’s initials, an historical figure who made Evanston the home of the Woman’s Christian Temperance Union. Ironically, Frances was a staunch supporter of prohibition and was one of many who played part in ensuring Evanston remained a dry city beginning in 1855 and finally ending in 1972. The company currently produces four spirits - Bourbon Whiskey, Barrel Gin, Rye Whiskey, and American Gin.

FEW Bourbon is aged in small barrels ranging in size from 5 to 30 gallons. The barrels are made from Minnesota oak which has a shorter growth season and tighter grain than other types of oak.

The bottle in review is Batch # 5/14, Barrel # 13-339, Bottle # 118. This information is handwritten on the side of the bottle along with the distiller’s signature.","Cherries, rich caramel, and seasoned wood mingle with burnt brown sugar and other scents I can’t quite zero in on. This complex array of scents is wrapped in young grains and balanced with a light spicy burn. Even though it’s rough around the edges, it’s actually quite enjoyable and not a turn-off considering how obviously young it comes off. It’s an odd mix of wonderfully interesting and strangely inviting, yet obviously under-aged.","Big corn and spice upfront. The graininess becomes much more evident here and it starts to take a turn for the worst. Bits of caramel and vanilla tease through, but whatever potentially good flavors that were noticed on the nose are overpowered by grain and alcohol.","The downhill momentum continues into the finish. It becomes bitter, tannic, and almost sour. Hints of oak and a light sweetness are present, but overpowered by the tannic flavors. It ends on its lowest note.","The interesting aspect about craft bourbons is each is unique in its own right. FEW is no exception. While I personally dislike the flavor of this particular bourbon, I will also say I don’t have anything else in my cabinet that tastes like it. It has the potential to be a far better bourbon if it could spend more time in the barrel to smooth out the rough edges and allow the complexity noticed on the nose to show through into the palate and finish. Alternatively, maybe the smaller barrels used for aging are bringing in too many tannins, and FEW should just move to larger barrels and longer aging altogether to allow this bourbon’s real potential to show through.

Despite the lack of any specific evidence of a difference in flavor profile created by Minnesota oak, it is something not otherwise discussed by other distilleries and likely has an impact on the final flavor. Moreover, it’s evident that FEW takes care in controlling their process right down to the wood used to make their barrels which is a promising sign from an exciting upstart distillery that seems to be doing just about everything right.","Value is tricky when it comes to craft whiskeys. As you may have noticed, we don’t review too many limited distribution craft whiskeys and instead focus on whiskeys with widespread distribution, which is somewhat by design. It’s not that we don’t appreciate locally-distributed craft, in fact, it’s the opposite. We prefer to write up distillery tours and talk in a general sense, as we understand take-off can be a little bumpy and these craft distillers are working with what they have - limited budgets, limited time to age and bring to market, their own learning process, etc. While some of the largest distilleries can deliver pretty decent 4 year-old plus bourbons for under $20, that is obviously not the mark we set for craft distillers and as a result, reviews of new and highly limited distribution craft whiskeys may come across unnecessarily harsh when, in fact, we really do support the craft movement.

Like a number of other craft distillers FEW Spirits has achieved fairly widespread distribution, so a comparison with mainstream competition is arguably fair. FEW Rye received the Craft Whiskey of the Year in 2013 from Whiskey Advocate and was scooped off the shelves immediately - although I haven’t tasted it yet I still have my hopes up. Whether FEW Rye can compete nationally is not the topic here though, the whiskey in review is FEW Bourbon. In order to appreciate this one I think you’ll need to have a connection with the distillery in some way, no different than many other craft spirits and in that case it will feel fairly priced. Without that connection though it’s just another $50 bottle of bourbon amongst many others. It's flavor profile is just too rough and under-developed to warrant its price or ability to fairly compete with other widely distributed bourbons in the $50 price range.",FEW Bourbon Whiskey is a rough-around-the-edges downhill ride from nose to finish - a surprise from a distillery surrounded by overwhelmingly positive accolades and a product with fairly widespread availability.,"FEW Spirits is a well respected upstart craft distillery with positive accolades surrounding them. I’m excited to visit them someday and sample the rest of their spirits. Unfortunately, the cause for widespread distribution of FEW Bourbon Whiskey is not justified by the taste of the spirit within the bottle. It’s young, rough, and I feel it’s possible the demands of widespread distribution may have caused FEW to sacrifice the quality of the end product here in order to bring it to market faster. I would like to have seen this bourbon aged longer or in larger barrels as it shows a great deal of promise, with a complex and interesting nose and incredibly deep color considering the age and proof. Unfortunately, without a flavor profile to back it up, I’m now quite hesitant to purchase another FEW product without taste-testing first.

After I wrote my review I looked around and noticed most reviews are positive for this one, with my opinion in the minority. I definitely see the potential, but the end result just isn’t there for me. Maybe it’s my batch or just my palate. Despite that, I still think it’s a risk at its price point and one that I’d recommend sampling before making a purchase.

I also noticed a fairly dense amount of particulate in my bottle when held up to the light. This isn’t necessarily a bad thing, but something I rarely notice and it was extensively more dense than any other bottle I compared it with. I’m curious if this is an anomaly or consistent with other FEW bottlings.",Nick,3,1.5,1,3,2,1.5,https://www.breakingbourbon.com/review/few-bourbon-whiskey
,Forged Oak,Classification: Straight Bourbon,Company: Diageo/Orphan Barrell Whiskey Distilling Co.,Distillery: New Bernheim Distillery,Released: February 2015,Proof: 90.5,Age: 15 Years,"Mashbill: 86% Corn, 8% Malted Barley, 6% Rye",Color:  Golden Copper,MSRP: $65,Official Website,"Forged Oak was produced between 1997 and 1998 at the New Bernheim Distillery, before being stored for 15 years in the Stitzel-Weller rickhouses. It’s reported mashbill is: 86% Corn, 8% Barley, 6% Rye. Review bottle #39,223. This is the fifth release in the Orphan Barrel line.","A very sunny nose filled with caramel, honey, and vanilla notes. While many bourbons also carry these aromas, few come off this sweet. This is surprising for a 15-year-old bourbon since older bourbons are usually weighed down with heavy oak notes. While the nose also sports leather and toasted oak, they’re quite tame and mingle well with the other aromas. If I didn’t know this bourbon’s age, I would guess it’s much lower than 15 years based on its nose.","The sweetness of the nose is noticeably absent on the palate and is replaced with doses of leather, cedar, and smoke. I would call these barrel flavors overpowering, but that doesn’t even cover it because there just aren’t any other flavors present for them to overpower. Try hard enough and you might be able to taste minor hints of maple and dark cherries. This is an extremely boring one-dimensional palate. I don’t think I’ve ever had a bourbon that is so spiritless.","There is more peppery rye spice on the finish but that’s about it. The dry finish doesn’t quite hit you at first, but it definitely sticks around. There’s nothing wrong with a dry finish, but one that doesn’t also ride out with other flavors makes for an extremely flat and dull experience.","I’m repeatedly crestfallen with each Orphan Barrel release and I don’t know why I never learn my lesson. On paper these releases always seem so unique. Their mystery origins, high age statements, and brilliant bottle/label design continues to put a spell on me. My main complaints with each release have been their over-oaked and under-flavored palates. Where most of the releases have had a decent flavor foundation that showed at least some potential, Forged Oak doesn’t even have that.

For a bourbon to sport only barrel-related flavors is pretty unique. This can be expected of any ultra-aged bourbon, but one aged at only a slightly high 15 years makes this all the more perplexing. Curiosity aside, a flavor profile consisting only of leather, cedar, and smoke doesn’t sound that appealing and it tastes even worse. Where all of the other Orphan Barrels suffered from a low proof point, Forged Oak’s equally low proof is probably what saves it from being a complete abomination. Yes, there’s a lot of oak flavor, but it’s the 90.2 proof that keeps the intensity of the oak flavor at manageable levels. If you ever wanted to have the experience of tasting what a really old whiskey is like, here’s your chance in a 15-year-old bottle.","With three out of five bottles in the Orphan Barrel line all retailing close to $100 or more, Forged Oak’s $65 MSRP is certainly more attractive. There also isn't a lot of available bourbons on the market in this above-average age range. It’s the high age statements of the Orphan Barrel line that are its best selling point. The age and price alone are what will sell Forged Oak and that is what’s unfortunate. There are so many better and less expensive bourbons on the market that deserve the attention that Forged Oak will undoubtedly get. Sure, it’s a great value for the age, but it’s not a great value for the quality of the bourbon you're buying. This has been a recurring statement with each Orphan Barrel release.","A sunny nose gives way to a dim, one-dimensional palate and dry finish that takes it’s namesake to heart.","After five Orphan Barrel releases it’s pretty safe to say that you’re playing the bourbon lottery when you buy one of these bottles. It’s a risk. Your chances are probably slim that it’s going to be great, but curiosity often wins out. The never-ending search for the next-best-thing is unwavering. The second you call it quits, someone will call the new release the next Pappy. It’s that self-destructing thinking that continues to fuel this line.

I really had high hopes for Forged Oak after smelling its fantastic nose. Like many of the Orphan Barrel bourbons, it started with a great nose, but then went downhill from there. While none of the Orphan Barrels have been a complete bomb, the best way to sum them up is with the saying, “I’m not mad at you. I’m just really disappointed in you.”",Eric,3.5,1.5,1,4,2,1.5,https://www.breakingbourbon.com/review/forged-oak

It's basic with no depth.",Typical bourbon flavors of caramel and vanilla. Tiny amount of fruit and honey. Very ho-hum palate with weak flavor all around.,Smooth mellow finish with medium length. Corn and vanilla are present but overall the finish leaves little impression on you.,"It's hard to find anything unique about this bourbon. If it wasn’t for the brand’s long history and strong marketing technique, it would likely be a flop if coming onto the market today.  But before the pitchforks come out, let me back up my point. Jim Beam white label isn’t meant to be unique. It’s mellow, low proof and low cost for a reason: so as many people can enjoy it as possible. There’s nothing inherently bad about the bourbon. It’s designed for any level of bourbon drinker, or for that matter any alcohol drinker, to not be offended by the taste. That is why you see it in every bar in America.","Jim Beam is a budget bourbon pure and simple. Probably more times than not, it’s where many people start their bourbon journey. Its low proof and price make it a great place to start. For people who want to make whiskey mixed drinks, low price is often the number one thing they’re looking for. If we’re going to critically look at this bourbon though, then all of the bourbon’s attributes must be examined. Its mild flavor, lack of complexity and low proof point don’t make it a great sipper. There are many fantastic bourbons on the market for $5 dollars more. At just $10 dollars more, there are many bourbons that are light years ahead of this.","A starter bourbon that mixes well, but is boring as a sipper.","With Jim Beam white label, it all comes down to what you’re looking for. Compared to other budget bourbons, it’s probably one of the best inexpensive bourbons on the market. Many people are also probably planning to mix it with something else. If you’re someone that doesn’t want to have a strong bourbon taste in your mixed drink, Jim Beam is your bourbon. Its mellow flavors will probably blend well with just about anything. But, if you’re someone that wants to sip their bourbon and enjoy its finer points, Jim Beam white label is not your bourbon. This is why Jim Beam also sells their Double Aged and Single Barrel, not to mention their small batch series. Again, it all comes down to what you’re looking for in a bourbon and how much you want to spend.",Eric,1.5,1.5,1.5,0.5,2.5,1.5,https://www.breakingbourbon.com/review/jim-beam-white-label-bourbon

Sherry and mint hit first. A small amount of sweetness hides behind a very upfront blast of copper. Leather trails on the backend of the nose.,Very flat. Earthy overtones with spice and barely undertones that never reach any height.,"A bit more flavorful than the palate with more oak prevalent. Some spice and fresh herbs show up for a moment. Surprisingly, it has very little heat (and flavor) for 101 proof. It goes down easy.","The peculiar nose is what you’ll notice most with this bourbon. Your sense of curiosity will spark as sherry and copper are very prevalent. It smells quite different from most bourbons, but that doesn’t automatically make it a winner. The nose comes off like it’s a barrel finished bourbon, yet it isn’t. For how unique the nose is, it still seems like it’s missing another key ingredient to make it great. It has far too much copper when more spice or sweetness was needed.","At $30, it’s priced on the high side for what it is. It’s unique nose and flavor aren’t quite good enough to warrant this price. Maybe at a higher proof point this would have been a more flavorful and interesting bourbon. As is, it makes you feel like you’re getting a raw deal.",Scotch-like qualities aren’t enough to forget the flat palate and warrant the high price.,"If you’re a bourbon lover, this can be an interesting stop on your journey. Its nose is different enough to warrant a quick look, but not special enough to spend much time with. The palate is one of the flattest I’ve had. The finish, much like the nose can be interesting if you have a developed flavor palate to compare it to. It’s scotch-like qualities are light but present.

,Old Overholt Rye,Classification: Straight Rye,Company: Beam Suntory,Distillery: Jim Beam Distillery/A. Overholt & Co.,Released: Ongoing,Proof: 80 Proof,Age: 3 Years,Mashbill: Undisclosed,Color:  Gold,MSRP: $19 (2018),Official Website,"Old Overholt is said to be America’s oldest continually-maintained brand of whiskey having been founded in West Overton, Pennsylvania in 1810. After World War 2, Americans turned to clear spirits, and Old Overholt soon found itself as the only nationally distributed straight rye whiskey on the market. Despite being the only rye on the market, it struggled, and in 1987 was sold to James B. Beam Distilling Company. After the sale, production was moved to Kentucky. Beam Suntory markets Old Overholt as one of the “The Olds” along with Old Grand-Dad.","Sweet scents of graham cracker, caramel, and vanilla frosting are at the forefront overtop a citrusy orange base. The nose is quite expressive for an 80 proof whiskey. Minor notes of oak and rye spice are also present, but barely make an impact over the sweet aromas.","The palate is extremely thin and watery with a very basic composition. It’s hard to readily pick out any flavors due to them being so diluted. There are faint traces of leather, cinnamon, and orange, but they’re weak and muddled.","The same flavors that are present in the palate ramp up a notch on the finish, but quickly fade, barely leaving a trace they were even there. For a brief moment these flavors show some hope before they quickly evaporate. It’s a shame since that moment isn’t all that bad.","Old Overholt has been a mainstay in bars for as long as anyone can remember. It amazes me this is commonly used as a mixing whiskey since its lack of boldness couldn’t possibly stand up to any mixing agent. Of course that can probably be said of any rail spirit a bar uses. The whiskey does deserve some credit, despite it only being three years old, it doesn’t have the typical young, harsh taste to it that many young whiskeys do. But how often do you see or hear anyone ordering up an Old Overholt neat?  It’s expected for an 80 proof whiskey to be mild, but I can’t remember one that was this thin and lacking so much character. As a result this is probably the smoothest and easiest drinking whiskey I’ve ever had. Of course you might be able to say that about any whiskey if you dumped enough water into it. This is a common complaint of 80 proof whiskeys, but Old Overholt’s lack of character in particular seems to exemplify this. The brand might have an interesting history, but in its current state, this is truly one of the most boring whiskeys I've ever had.","The brand’s longevity and placement in many bars is probably the result of its price: It’s cheap. It’s one of the least expensive ryes on the market. For some that’s important, but for a few dollars more, Rittenhouse Rye Bottled in Bond is the better buy. This might be why Beam released a bottled in bond version of Old Overholt Rye that's aged an additional year. At 80 proof, Old Overholt has little to offer. It’s not that every whiskey has to shoot for the moon in hopes to satisfy every whiskey drinker, but Old Overholt can barely get off the ground.","Easy to love its price, but hard to love anything else about it.","It makes some amount of sense that Old Overholt comes from the same company that makes Jim Beam White Label. Both whiskeys are similar in their lack of strong character and watery nature. Both are drinkable and have some redeeming qualities, but it’s clear they aren’t trying to be anything other than a budget whiskey. There of course isn’t anything wrong with that - especially at always increasing bar prices - but there’s simply better options at only a few dollars more. If you’re looking for a whiskey that is extremely easy to drink, inexpensive, or something for a first timer that isn’t accustomed to whiskey’s bold nature, Old Overholt can fill that role. Otherwise this is one to to pass up every time.",Eric,2.5,1.5,2,1,1.5,1.5,https://www.breakingbourbon.com/review/old-overholt-rye
,The Gifted Horse,Classification: Whiskey,Company: Diageo/Orphan Barrel Distilling Co.,Distillery: Sourced from MGP and Bernheim Distillery,Released: February 2016,Proof: 115,Age: Blend of 4 year old bourbon & corn whiskey along with a 17 year old bourbon,Mashbill: Undisclosed,Color:  Caramel,MSRP: $50 (2015),Official Website,"Gifted Horse was an accidental blend according to Diageo. It’s comprised of 51% 4 year old MGP bourbon, 38.5% 17 year old Bernheim bourbon, and 10.5% 4 year old MGP corn whiskey according to the company’s press release. This is the seventh release in the Orphan Barrel line and the first without a double digit age statement.

Review bottle number 33,866","Easily summed up as sweet, mild, and leaning on the basic side of the scale. Notes of vanilla, sweet corn, citrus, and a bit of dark fruit are wrapped up with a caramel bow. There’s a bit of youth on the nose that is well balanced by a faint hint of age from oak undertones. Far from heavy or overpowering, these oak influencers provide a nice foundation to an otherwise wobbly structure. Pleasant smelling, but run-of-the-mill.","Strong oak upfront with vanilla following in tow. A faint hint of caramel sweetness struggles to pull through the oak. Extremely basic and limited showing of flavors makes you wonder if they were even there in the first place. Its dearth of flavors and absence of memorable characteristics make this a soulless whiskey. To describe it as pure grain alcohol isn’t quite fair, but its lack of depth and overall weak flavor puts it on the fringe of that classification.","Harsh is an understatement here. This finishes with the heat of a barrel proof whiskey without the additional intensity of flavors that generally comes with it. Oak is once again the dominating flavor on the finish, but I don’t get the sense that it’s silencing other flavors. Like the palate, the finish lacks a noticeable range in flavor. Far on the backend is a bit of dryness that brings with it a musty aftertaste that’s mild in intensity, but never-the-less unpleasant and unwanted. This alone doesn't ruin the finish, since it was already ruined well before this point.","Diageo is marketing Gifted Horse as an accident. The company says they never intended to mix 4 year old bourbon and corn whiskey into their 17 year old Tennessee bourbon stock. “Accidental whiskey” is becoming a trend within the bourbon industry over the last few years, and it makes you think these massive multi-million dollar companies are run by The Three Stooges.

That said, it’s not exactly common for a major whiskey company to mix corn whiskey into aged bourbon stock, so in a way, Gifted Horse is a bit unique. In this case though, unique isn’t synonymous with great. If this wasn’t actually an accident, a logical conclusion why this blend exists is that Diageo had a number of not-so-great 17 year old bourbon barrels that needed to be cut with younger whiskey. Blending old with young isn’t new and the end result, in theory, should produce something that mutually compensates for the other’s flaws. Instead, the corn whiskey and aged bourbon blend together like oil and water. The harsh grain flavoring of the corn whiskey is immediately contrasted by the dry oaky traits of the 17 year old bourbon. Even the inclusion of a larger ratio of 4 year old bourbon into the mix isn’t enough to round out the flavor profile, though it might have made a more positive impact if it was a little older or more mature tasting. Sure Gifted Horse’s blend is unique, but it’s also something I probably could have replicated myself with better results. With a blend this haphazard, maybe this truly was an accident.","At $50, Gifted Horse is the least Diageo has charged for an Orphan Barrel whiskey, and it's for good reason. The company probably did ample research to figure out what the market would be willing to pay for this blend of whiskeys. The thing is, if it tasted good, who ultimately cares what’s in it? The flavor would justify its price. The problem is it doesn’t. We’ve reviewed a fews sub-$20 bottom shelf whiskeys and most of them are superior to Gifted Horse. How Diageo has the audacity to charge anywhere close to $50 for this is an insult to their customers, and is probably doing more harm than good to their Orphan Barrel brand, which is already a controversial brand to begin with.","Thanks to a basic palate and hot finish, this “accident” should have never made it to store shelves.","On paper, Gifted Horse looked to correct many of the complaints leveled against the Orphan Barrel line. It’s higher proof than previous Orphan Barrel releases along with the inclusion of young corn whiskey and bourbon should have mellowed the intensity of the oak notes that have plagued this series. Unfortunately, the higher proof brought with it an uncomfortable amount of burn and the corn whiskey completely sticks out against the dry oak notes of 17 year old bourbon. In a way, this marriage brought out the worst in each other. There is one thing I can confidently award Gifted Horse: Worst Orphan Barrel release yet.",Eric,2.5,2,1.5,3,1,1.5,https://www.breakingbourbon.com/review/the-gifted-horse
,Woodford Reserve Master's Collection: Sonoma-Cutrer Pinot Noir Finish,Classification: Whiskey,Company: Brown-Forman,Distillery: Woodford Reserve Distillery  / Brown-Forman Distillery,Released: November 2014,Proof: 90,Age: NAS (Bourbon is roughly seven years old and spent another 10 months in wine barrels),"Mashbill: 72% Corn, 18% Rye, 10% Malted Barley",Color:  Cherry Red,MSRP: $100,Official Website,"Every year, Brown-Forman’s Master Distiller Chris Morris releases a special edition of Woodford Reserve called the Master’s Collection. For each release, Morris changes some aspect of the whiskey making process (i.e. barrel type, finish, grain, fermentation process, aging location and style). This November will see the ninth release of the Master’s Collection.

For the 2014 Master’s Collection release, fully matured, cask strength Woodford Reserve was rebarreled in Sonoma-Cutrer (owned by Woodford parent company, Brown-Forman) French oak Pinot Noir barrels, where it spent another 10 months. The wine barrels saw three wine vintages before they were filled with bourbon. Once the finishing process was completed, the final product was bottled at 90 proof (the same as standard Woodford Reserve). A total of 36,334 bottles were produced for this one-time release.","It has a big cherry and fruity perfumed kick to it that overpowers any traditional bourbon scents. It’s a rather odd mix of smells. Most shocking is that when it’s first poured from the bottle, the bourbon smells like its gone bad. Allowing some air to circulate in it helps open up some of the bourbon and oak aromas.","It has a very red fruit base to it. Cherry, currants and hints of strawberry and raspberry. Beneath the fruit are layers of oak, cedar and vanilla with touches of chocolate and earthiness. Very Pinot Noir tasting. While it has a medium body and nice mouthfeel, this bourbon is just overpowered by the wine that it was infused with from the barrel.","The finish leaves you with a funky aftertaste that lingers far too long. I actually squished my face when the the finish first hit. It tastes like some concoction you might have made in college when you were just learning to mix cocktails. It’s a mashup of flavors that that are completely unbalanced. It truly tastes like someone poured Pinot Noir in your bourbon and said, “Here drink this.” The flavors don’t mingle well and there is a very noticeable kick in Pinot Noir flavor near the end of the finish. This flavor really stays with you after the sip is gone, much like red wine does. That makes sense for wine, but with bourbon, it’s just odd.","Bourbon finished in wine barrels isn’t anything new. Although it hasn’t been done at high frequencies and in large quantities, this type of finishing has been explored before. Woodford even released one in 2007, which was finished in Sonoma-Cutrer Chardonnay barrels. 2014 saw an explosion of barrel finished bourbons with High West’s A Midwinter Night’s Dram having a similar wine barrel finish, but instead with port barrels. Where that bottle maintains a better balance between the bourbon and wine flavors, Woodford’s Sonoma-Cutrer Pinot Noir Finish takes its wine finish too far. The best barrel finishes are the ones that gently mingle flavors together and provide a nice balance between the original bourbon flavor and the new barrel finish flavors. We’ve reviewed two High West barrel finishes, A Midwinter Night’s Dram and Double Rye finished in Campfire Barrels, and both are great examples of proper finishing. Woodford might be onto something with their wine barrel finishes, but they seem like they need more time to test these before releasing them to the market.","As a stated one-off, much like Willett’s XCF, you’re paying for the privilege to taste something that will never be made [exactly the same] again. For some people its price point might seem fair to be given the opportunity to taste something brand new and very unique. If this was an everyday, on-the-shelf whiskey, Woodford could never charge $100 for it. It lacks proper refinement. Even the similar priced and superior A Midwinter Nights Dram is pushing the acceptable price boundary at $90. As is, Woodford’s Sonoma-Cutrer Pinot Noir Finish is overpriced for what‘s in the bottle.",An unbalanced experiment in wine barrel finishing.,"In many ways, bourbon and Pinot Noir share similar flavor characteristics, so it makes sense that someone would pair the two together. Unfortunately in this case, it tastes like someone simply poured too much Pinot Noir wine in a bottle of Woodford. Clearly this bourbon was aged in wine barrels for too long. The spike in grape flavor during its overly long finish can come as a shock. This is a whiskey that is best sipped by itself to gather any amount of enjoyment out of it. If you have this side by side with a traditional bourbon, it’s going to taste like it spoiled on you. As more and more unique whiskey “experiments” make their way to the market, it’s best to be an informed customer in this ever increasing market of expensive whiskey.",Eric,1.5,1.5,0.5,4,1.5,1.5,https://www.breakingbourbon.com/review/woodford-reserve-masters-collection-sonoma-cutrer-pinot-noir-finish
